# Details

Squid supports some operating systems whose last release was a LONG time
ago. It may be sensible to clean up the codebase a bit and drop support
for them

Removed in
[Squid-4](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/ObsoleteOses/Squid-4#) :

  - BSDi

  - SunOs \<4 (last release 1995)

  - Ultrix

Candidates for obsolescence are:

  - NextStep (last release 1994)
    
      - QNX is a current OS apparently based on
        [NextStep](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/ObsoleteOses/NextStep#)
        and needs checking to see whether it still relies on Next
        specific code.
