# Rolf Risiko

Email: `<r.risiko AT htnet . biz>`

Im just an Linux-/Networkadmin trying to help as much people i can. I
work with squid since 2011, and i love it.

Part of my daily tasks is to deploy, maintenance and monitor our proxy
"farms", wich i really enjoy.

I like working in small Teams, and i play around with squid almost at
least two times a week.

Id like to help you with your projects, feel free to contact me, i will
answer as soon as possible.
