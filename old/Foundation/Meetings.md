# Squid Software Foundation Board Meetings

The [Foundation](http://foundation.squid-cache.org/) Board of Directors
holds semi-regular meetings to discuss current Foundation affairs. This
page documents the next meeting logistics (if known), aggregates pending
to-do items, and indexes past meeting minutes.

Most of the Board discussions can be open to the public and your
constructive participation is encouraged. We currently do not have a
formal set of public participation rules. For now, please email Board
member(s) in advance if you would like to join the discussion of any
specific item(s) on the Draft Agenda. Most likely, you will need to wait
on \#squiddev for an invitation to join the meeting session when the
item(s) you are interested in are being discussed. We will eventually
formalize the procedure based on experience and demand.
