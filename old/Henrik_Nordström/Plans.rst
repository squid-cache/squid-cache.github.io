My plans for the development of Squid

 * [[Features/Optimizations|Eleminate unneeded copying]]

 * Fix up the forwarding path, allowing for [[Features/HTTP11|HTTP/1.1 (1xx)]]

 * Eleminate the in-core [[Features/NoCentralStoreIndex|store index]]

 * Look into how to effectively store things.

 * [[Features/StackableIO|Stackable I/O model]]

 * Implement [[Features/Optimizations|scatter-gather IO]]
