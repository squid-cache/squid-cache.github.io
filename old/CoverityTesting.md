The Squid project uses the services of [Coverity
Scan](https://communities.coverity.com/community/scan-%28open-source%29)
to run automated test builds, as part of the
[BuildFarm](/BuildFarm)
activities. Kudos to [Coverity](http://www.coverity.com/) for supporting
this useful community service.

Trunk will automatically be built (in "maximus" test-suite configuration
only") once a week and submitted to Coverity for analysis if the build
is successful.

In order to access the results of the analysis you need to register an
user by contacting `<kinkie@squid-cache.org>`. Please include in your
mail in your mail your name, surname, desired username, a valid email
address and a brief explanation of the motivation for requesting access.
If you are not a regular participant to any of the Squid mailing lists,
please also add a brief introduction or a link to some Net resource
detailing your background.

You can then access the Squid analysis results page at address
