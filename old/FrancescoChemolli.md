I'm involved with squid development since 2000, I've been working mainly
in the autentication area and on integration with Microsoft windows
authentication systems.

Besides this, I'm a general nag-person for the other developers and I'm
this wiki's admin.

I'm also known by the nickname "Kinkie".

I'm reachable by email at `<kinkie@squid-cache.org>`

# Development hints and bits

  - [Tokyo Cabinet](http://tokyocabinet.sourceforge.net/)
    
      - seems to be an interesting on-disk associative-array database (a
        la dbm, ndbm, gdbm, qdbm), it claims to be very fast. Might it
        be useful to store data or metadata?
