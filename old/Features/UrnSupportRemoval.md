# URN Support Removal

  - **Goal**: Squid has supported for a long time various URN features,
    but the technology just didn't fly, to the point that it's not even
    accepted by modern web browsers. In addition, most of the currently
    hardcoded practices can be easily achieved using different means,
    such as redirectors. Aim of the Feature is removing URN support
    code, except for what's needed to successfully parse URNs
