## use "completed" for completed projects, or remove entirely
 * '''Status''': not started; What is the current status? standard choices are ''not started'', ''in progress'', and ''completed''.

## Remove this entry once the feature has been merged into trunk.
 * '''ETA''': unknown. What is the estimated time of completion? Use either number of calendar days for not started features. Use an absolute date for started and completed features. Use ''unknown'' if unknown.
