# Tim Bates

Australian... From NSW to be more specific.

I first started playing with Squid in late 1998, and set up my first
"production" server in about June 99 as a part of sharing our dialup
connection at home.

I now run 3 Squid servers at 3 locations... one is at home, one at my
main job at a high school, and the 3rd is at a small government agency.
All 3 boxes have very different requirements, especially with regard to
access control.
