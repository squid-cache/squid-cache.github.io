My first Squid contributions were 1997 disk performance experiments (commit
[711982d](https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/commit/711982d)). Since then, I
have created and/or significantly improved many key Squid features such as SMP
support, Rock disk cache, ICAP/eCAP adaptation clients, SslBump, collapsed
forwarding, and Happy Eyeballs. Today, I orchestrate [Measurement
Factory](https://www.measurement-factory.com/) work on various Squid projects
and herd cats as a Squid Project [committer](/WhoWeAre.html#squid-core-team)
and Squid Software Foundation
[director](/WhoWeAre.html#the-squid-software-foundation-directors).
