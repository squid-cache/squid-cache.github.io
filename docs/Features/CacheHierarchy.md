# Feature: Linking Squid into a Cache Hierarchy

- **Goal**: To connect multiple Squid together forming a 'mesh' or
    hierarchy of caches.
- **Status**: completed.
- **Version**: 1.2

# Details

Proxy and Cache Hierarchies are built out of two basic peering linkages.
**parent** links (shown as green) and **sibling** links (show as blue).

These two simple connections can be combined in any number of complex
**hierarchies**. For example this cluster of 6 sibling caches with a
gateway proxy load balancing between them.

## How do I configure Squid forward all requests to another proxy?

First, you need to give Squid a parent cache with the
[cache_peer](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/cache_peer)
directive. Second, you need to tell Squid it can not connect directly to
origin servers with
[never_direct](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/never_direct).
This is done with these configuration file lines:

    cache_peer parentcache.foo.com parent 3128 0 no-query default
    never_direct allow all

Note, with this configuration, if the parent cache fails or becomes
unreachable, then every request will result in an error message.

In case you want to be able to use direct connections when all the
parents go down you should use a different approach:

    cache_peer parentcache.foo.com parent 3128 0 no-query
    prefer_direct off
    nonhierarchical_direct off

The default behavior of Squid in the absence of positive ICP, HTCP, etc
replies is to connect to the origin server instead of using parents. The
[prefer_direct](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/prefer_direct)
**off** directive tells Squid to try parents first before DNS listed
servers.

Certain types of requests cannot be cached or are served faster going
direct, and Squid is optimized to send them over direct connections by
default. The
[nonhierarchical_direct](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/nonhierarchical_direct)
**off** directive tells Squid to send these requests via the parent
anyway.

> :warning:
    The
    [hierarchy_stoplist](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/hierarchy_stoplist)
    directive is another which will cause traffic to go DIRECT instead
    of to a peer. It should be removed completely from
    [Squid-3.2](/Releases/Squid-3.2)
    and later configurations if present.

## How do I join a cache hierarchy?

To place your cache in a hierarchy, use the *cache_peer* directive in
*squid.conf* to specify the parent and sibling nodes.

For example, the following *squid.conf* file on
**childcache.example.com** configures its cache to retrieve data from
one parent cache and two sibling caches:

    #  squid.conf - On the host: childcache.example.com
    #
    #  Format is: hostname  type  http_port  udp_port
    #
    cache_peer parentcache.example.com   parent  3128 3130
    cache_peer childcache2.example.com   sibling 3128 3130
    cache_peer childcache3.example.com   sibling 3128 3130

> :warning:
    cache_peer_domain is deprecated and not longer available from
    current Squid versions.

The
[cache_peer_access](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/cache_peer_access)
directive allows you to specify that certain caches siblings or parents
for certain domains:

    #  squid.conf - On the host: sv.cache.nlanr.net
    #
    #  Format is: hostname  type  http_port  udp_port
    #
    cache_peer electraglide.geog.unsw.edu.au parent 3128 3130
    cache_peer cache1.nzgate.net.nz          parent 3128 3130
    cache_peer pb.cache.nlanr.net   parent 3128 3130
    cache_peer it.cache.nlanr.net   parent 3128 3130
    cache_peer sd.cache.nlanr.net   parent 3128 3130
    cache_peer uc.cache.nlanr.net   sibling 3128 3130
    cache_peer bo.cache.nlanr.net   sibling 3128 3130

    acl unsw dstdomain .au
    cache_peer_access electraglide.geog.unsw.edu.au allow unsw

    acl nzgate dstdomain .au .aq .fj .nz
    cache_peer_domain cache1.nzgate.net.nz allow nzgate

    acl nlanr-eu dstdomain .uk .de .fr .no .se .it
    cache_peer_domain pb.cache.nlanr.net allow nlanr-eu

    cache_peer_domain it.cache.nlanr.net allow nlanr-uk

    acl nlanr-sa dstdomain .mx .za .mu .zm
    cache_peer_domain sd.cache.nlanr.net allow nlanr-sa

The configuration above indicates that the cache will use
*pb.cache.nlanr.net* and *it.cache.nlanr.net* for domains uk, de, fr,
no, se and it, *sd.cache.nlanr.net* for domains mx, za, mu and zm, and
*cache1.nzgate.net.nz* for domains au, aq, fj, and nz.

## How do I join NLANR's cache hierarchy?

Currently (December 2022) unclear

## Why should I want to join NLANR's cache hierarchy?

The NLANR hierarchy can provide you with an initial source for parent or
sibling caches. Joining the NLANR global cache system will frequently
improve the performance of your caching service.

## How do I register my cache with NLANR's registration service?

Just enable these options in your *squid.conf* and you'll be registered:

    cache_announce 24
    announce_to sd.cache.nlanr.net:3131

> :warning: Announcing your cache **is not** the same thing as joining the NLANR cache hierarchy. You can join the NLANR cache hierarchy without registering, and you can register without joining the NLANR cache hierarchy

## How do I find other caches close to me and arrange parent/child/sibling relationships with them?

Visit the NLANR cache [registration
database](http://www.ircache.net/Cache/Tracker/) to discover other
caches near you. Keep in mind that just because a cache is registered in
the database **does not** mean they are willing to be your
parent/sibling/child. But it cannot hurt to ask...

## Troubleshooting

### My cache registration is not appearing in the Tracker database.

- Your site will not be listed if your cache IP address does not have
    a DNS PTR record. If we cannot map the IP address back to a domain
    name, it will be listed as "Unknown."
- The registration messages are sent with UDP. We may not be receiving
    your announcement message due to firewalls which block UDP, or
    dropped packets due to congestion.
