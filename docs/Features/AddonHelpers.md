## Details

Every network and installation have their own criteria for operation.
The squid developers and community do not have the time or inclination
to write code for every minor situation. Instead we provide ways to
easily extend various operations with local add-on scripts or programs
we call helpers.

### What language are helper meant to be written in?

Helpers can be written in any language you like. They can be executable
programs or interpreted scripts.

The helpers bundled with Squid are currently written in Bash shell
script, awk script, perl script, and C++. There are also frameworks
available for helpers built in Python or Ruby.


:warning: There are several languages which encounter difficulties though:
 - Perl, Python
    Certain methods of writing output to stdout automatically append newline characters. Care must be taken that only one set of newlines are output with the response
  - PHP
    Various versions of the Zend 5.x engine have bugs related to I/O and execution timeouts. Others have bugs in configuration settings used to control these timeouts. In general it is best to avoid PHP entirely unless one wants to spend a great deal of time testing and finding workaround for these issues. Some of these bugs do not have solutions
  - Go
    read() operation seems to have some form of timeout on threads which returns socket-closed signals. Causing a multi-threaded concurrent helper to exit if its least-used thread times out. There is no known workaround or solution for this.
    :information_source: As of Go version 1.12.1 the issue appears to be resolved

### How do the helpers communicate with Squid?

The interface with Squid is very simple. The helper is passed a limited
amount of information on stdin to perform their expected task. The
result is passed back to Squid via stdout. With any errors or debugging
traces sent back on stderr.

  - The helper is expected to wait for input before responding. Early
    responses or unexpected lines arriving to Squid on stdin will result
    in the helper being shut down with errors. If that happens often
    Squid may terminate as well.
  - The helper is expected to handle multiple lookups by Squid. It is a
    terrible drag on HTTP speed to be constantly re-starting helpers. If
    that happens often enough Squid may terminate as well.

See the particular interface protocols below for details about the line
syntax the helper is expected to receive and send on each interface.

### Why is my helper not starting up with Squid?

Squid-3.2 and newer support dynamic helper initialization. That means
the helper is only started if it needs to be. If Squid is configured
with startup=N value greater than 0 you can expect that many of your
helper to be started when Squid starts. But this is not necessarily a
desirable thing for Squid needing fast startup or restart times.

With startup=0 configured the first HTTP request through Squid is
expected to start at least one instance for most of the helpers. But if
for example an external ACL is configured and is only tested on rare
occasions its helper will not be started until that rare occasion
happens for the first time.

### What happens when Squid shuts down or reconfigures?

When shutting down, reconfiguring, or in other times Squid needs to
shutdown a helper Squid schedules closure of the stdin connection of the
helper. When all the in-progress lookups are completed the helper should
receive this close signal when reading stdin.

Shutting down or restarting are limited by the
[shutdown\_timeout](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/shutdown_timeout#)
which may cause Squid to abort earlier than receiving all the responses.
If this happens the client connections are also being terminated just as
abruptly as the helper - so the lost helper responses are not an issue.

### Can I write a helper that talks to Squid on more than one interface?

You can. In a way.

Squid runs the configured helper for each interface as a separate child
process. Your helper can be written to detect other running instances of
itself and communicate between them, effectively sharing memory and/or
state outside of Squid regardless of the interface Squid is using to run
each instance.

NP: Just keep in mind that the number of instances (children) running on
each interface is configurable and could be anything from zero to many
hundreds. So do not make any assumptions about which interface another
instance is running on.

        [Features/SslServerCertValidator](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/AddonHelpers/Features/SslServerCertValidator#)

squid-3.5+ support:

  - flexible key-extras extensions to helper lookup request lines

Squid-3.1 and later also support [eCAP plugins](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/AddonHelpers/Features/eCAP#)
and [ICAP services](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/AddonHelpers/Features/ICAP#)
which differ from helper scripts in many ways.

## Helper states

An individual helper *process* may be in one or more of the following
states:

| Key | Name | Meaning |
| --- | ---- | ------- |
| B | BUSY | Squid is expecting a response from the helper process |
| W | WRITING | Squid is sending one or more requests to a stateless helper process. Squid has not been notified that all the sent data has been written. A WRITING helper is a BUSY helper. Please note that *reporting* this state is currently not supported for stateful helpers. |
| R | RESERVED | Squid is sending a request to a *stateful* helper process. Squid has not been notified that all the sent data has been written. |
| P | PLACEHOLDER | There is at least one master transaction waiting for this stateful helper (but not necessarily this specific stateful helper *process*) to become available (i.e. not BUSY). |
| C | CLOSING | Squid closed its writing socket for the helper process, but the helper has not quit yet (or, to be more precise, has not closed its stdout yet). |
| S | SHUTDOWN PENDING | Squid marked this helper process for eventual closure but has not yet initiated that closure (usually because the helper is still BUSY). |

The above table does not reflect some esoteric corner cases, especially
when it comes for conditions for ending a helper state. For example, a
stateful helper process may stop being RESERVED for reasons other than
writing the entire request data to the helper process.

Squid [Cache Manager](/Features/CacheManager/)
reports individual helper states on helper-specific pages such as
mgr:store\_io.

## Helper protocols

:information_source:
Squid-2.6 and later all support concurrency, however the bundled helpers
and many third-party commercial helpers do not. This is changing, the
use of concurrency is encouraged to improve performance. The relevant
squid.conf concurrency setting must match the helper concurrency
support. The [helper multiplexer](/Features/HelperMultiplexer)
wrapper can be used to add concurrency benefits to most non-concurrent
helpers.

  - :alert: For every line sent by Squid exactly one line is
    expected back. Some script language such as perl and python need to
    be careful about the number of newlines in their output.
    
  - :alert: Note that the helper programs other than logging can not use
    buffered I/O.

### Key=Value pairs (kv-pairs) format

The interface for all helpers has been extended to support arbitrary
lists of key=value pairs, with the syntax `  key=value  `. Some keys
have special meaning to Squid, as documented here. All messages from
squid are URL-escaped (the `  rfc1738_unescape  ` from rfc1738.h can be
used to decode them. For responses, the safe way is to either
URL-escape, or to enclose the value in double\_quotes ("); any
double-quotes or backslashes (\\) in the value need to be prefixed by a
backslash, \\r and \\n are replaced respectively by CR and LF

Some example key values:

``` 
                user=John%20Smith
                user="John Smith"
                user="J. \"Bob\" Smith"
```

### URL manipulation

Input line received from Squid:

    [channel-ID] URL [key-extras]

  - channel-ID
    
      - This is an ID for the line when concurrency is enabled. When
        concurrency is turned off (set to **1**) this field and the
        following space will be completely missing.

  - URL
    
      - The URL received from the client. In Squid with ICAP support,
        this is the URL after ICAP REQMOD has taken place.

  - key-extras
    
      - Starting with
        [Squid-3.5](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/AddonHelpers/Squid-3.5#)
        additional parameters passed to the helper which may be
        configured with
        [url\_rewrite\_extras](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/url_rewrite_extras#).
        For backward compatibility the default key-extras for URL
        helpers matches the format fields sent by
        [Squid-3.4](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/AddonHelpers/Squid-3.4#)
        and older in this field position:
    
    <!-- end list -->
    
      - ``` 
         ip/fqdn ident method [urlgroup] kv-pair
        ```

  - ip
    
      - This is the IP address of the client. Followed by a slash
        (**/**) as shown above.

  - fqdn
    
      - The FQDN rDNS of the client, if any is known. Squid does not
        normally perform lookup unless needed by logging or ACLs. Squid
        does not wait for any results unless ACLs are configured to
        wait. If none is available **-** will be sent to the helper
        instead.

  - ident
    
      - The IDENT protocol username (if known) of the client machine.
        Squid will not wait for IDENT username to become known unless
        there are ACL which depend on it. So at the time re-writers are
        run the IDENT username may not yet be known. If none is
        available **-** will be sent to the helper instead.

  - method
    
      - The HTTP request method. URL alterations and particularly
        redirection are only possible on certain methods, and some such
        as POST and CONNECT require special care.

  - urlgroup
    
      - Squid-2 will send this field with the URL-grouping tag which can
        be configured on
        [http\_port](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/http_port#).
        Squid-3.x will not send this field.

  - kv-pair
    
      - One or more key=value pairs. Only "myip" and "myport" pairs
        documented below were ever defined and are sent unconditionally
        by
        [Squid-3.4](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/AddonHelpers/Squid-3.4#)
        and older:
        
        | ---------- | ----------------------- |
        | myip=...   | Squid receiving address |
        | myport=... | Squid receiving port    |
        

#### HTTP Redirection

Redirection can be performed by helpers on the
[url\_rewrite\_program](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/url_rewrite_program#)
interface. Lines performing either redirect or re-write can be produced
by the same helpers on a per-request basis. Redirect is preferred since
re-writing URLs introduces a large number of problems into the client
HTTP experience.

The input line received from Squid is detailed by the section above.

Redirectors send a slightly different format of line back to Squid.

Result line sent back to Squid:

    [channel-ID] [result] [kv-pairs] [status:URL]

  - channel-ID
    
      - When a concurrency **channel-ID** is received it must be sent
        back to Squid unchanged as the first entry on the line.

  - result
    
      - One of the result codes:
        
        |     |                                            |
        | --- | ------------------------------------------ |
        | OK  | Success. A new URL is presented.           |
        | ERR | Success. No action for this URL.           |
        | BH  | Failure. The helper encountered a problem. |
        

      - ![{i}](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/wiki/squidtheme/img/icon-info.png)
        the result field is only accepted by

        | status=...         | HTTP status code to use on the redirect. Must be one of: 301, 302, 303, 307, 308                           |
        | tag=...            | reserved                                                                                                   |
        | ttl=...            | reserved                                                                                                   |
        | url=...            | redirect the client to given URL                                                                           |
        | \*\_=...           | Key names ending in (\_) are reserved for local administrators use.                                        |
        

      - ![{i}](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/wiki/squidtheme/img/icon-info.png)
        the kv-pair field is only accepted by
        [Squid-3.4](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/AddonHelpers/Squid-3.4#)
        and newer.
    
      - ![{i}](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/wiki/squidtheme/img/icon-info.png)
        the kv-pair returned by this helper can be logged by the
        **%note**
        [logformat](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/logformat#)
        code.

  - status
    
      - The HTTP 301, 302 or 307 status code. Please see section 10.3 of
        RFC [2616](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616#) for an
        explanation of the HTTP redirect codes and which request methods
        they may be sent on.

  - URL
    
      - The URL to be used instead of the one sent by the client. This
        must be an absolute URL. ie starting with [](http://) or
        [](ftp://) etc.
    
    ![{i}](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/wiki/squidtheme/img/icon-info.png)
    If no action is required leave status:URL area blank.
    
    ![{i}](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/wiki/squidtheme/img/icon-info.png)
    The **status** and **URL** are separated by a colon (**:**) as shown
    above instead of whitespace.

#### URL Re-Writing (Mangling)

URL re-writing can be performed by helpers on the
[url\_rewrite\_program](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/url_rewrite_program#),
[storeurl\_rewrite\_program](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/storeurl_rewrite_program#)
and
[location\_rewrite\_program](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/location_rewrite_program#)
interfaces.

WARNING: when used on the url\_rewrite\_program interface re-writing
URLs introduces a large number of problems into the client HTTP
experience. Some of these problems can be mitigated with a paired helper
running on the
[location\_rewrite\_program](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/location_rewrite_program#)
interface de-mangling the server redirection URLs.

Result line sent back to Squid:

    [channel-ID] [result] [kv-pair] [URL]

  - channel-ID
    
      - When a concurrency **channel-ID** is received it must be sent
        back to Squid unchanged as the first entry on the line.

        etc.

#### Store ID de-duplication

URL to Store-ID mapping can be performed by helpers on the
[storeid\_rewrite\_program](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/storeid_rewrite_program#)
interface.

WARNING: care must be taken that the URLs de-duplicated onto one shared
ID are actually duplicates. Clients needing to revalidate will cause the
cached object to be sourced from either of the duplicate locations. If
they are not real duplicates this can randomly cause major issues with
the client experience.

    URL-rewrite](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/AddonHelpers/Features/StoreUrlRewrite#)
    feature helpers written for
    [Squid-2.7](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/AddonHelpers/Squid-2.7#).
    However that syntax is deprecated and such helpers should be
    upgraded as soon as possible to use this Store-ID syntax.

### Authenticator

#### Basic Scheme

Input line received from Squid:

    [channel-ID] username password [key-extras]

  - channel-ID
    
      - This is an ID for the line when concurrency is enabled. When
        concurrency is turned off (set to **1**) this field and the
        following space will be completely missing.

  - username
    
      - The username field sent by the client in HTTP headers. It may be
        empty or missing.

  - password
    
      - The password value sent by the client in HTTP headers. May be
        empty or missing.

  - key-extras
    
      - Additional parameters passed to the helper which may be
        configured with
        [auth\_param](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/auth_param#)

        [Squid-3.5](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/AddonHelpers/Squid-3.5#)
        and later.

Result line sent back to Squid:

### Access Control (ACL)

This interface has a very flexible field layout. The administrator may
configure any number or order of details from the relevant HTTP request
or reply to be sent to the helper.

Input line received from Squid:

    [channel-ID] format-options [acl-value [acl-value ...]]

  - channel-ID
    
      - This is an ID for the line when concurrency is enabled. When
        concurrency is turned off (**concurrency=1**) in
        [external\_acl\_type](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/external_acl_type#)
        this field and the following space will be completely missing.

  - format-options
    
      - This is the flexible series of tokens configured as the
        **FORMAT** area of
        [external\_acl\_type](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/external_acl_type#).
        The tokens are space-delimited and exactly match the order of
        **%** tokens in the configured **FORMAT**. By default in current
        releases these tokens are also URL-encoded according to RFC
        [1738](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738#) to protect against
        whitespace and binary data problems.

  - acl-value
    
      - Some ACL tests such as group name comparisons pass their test
        values to the external helper following the admin configured
        FORMAT. Depending on the ACL these may be sent one value at a
        time, as a list of values, or nothing may be sent. By default in
        current releases these tokens are also URL-encoded according to
        RFC [1738](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738#) to protect
        against whitespace and binary data problems.
        
          - ![/\!\\](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/wiki/squidtheme/img/alert.png)
            In
            [Squid-4](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/AddonHelpers/Squid-4#)
            these acl-value expand to a dash ('-') if there is no %DATA
            macro used in the format-options. In older Squid this would
            have expanded to whitespace.

Result line sent back to Squid:

    [channel-ID] result [kv-pair]

  - channel-ID
    
      - When a concurrency **channel-ID** is received it must be sent
        back to Squid unchanged as the first entry on the line.

  - result
    
      - One of the result codes:
        
        |     |                                            |
        | --- | ------------------------------------------ |
        | OK  | Success. ACL test matches.                 |
        | ERR | Success. ACL test fails to match.          |
        | BH  | Failure. The helper encountered a problem. |
        

      - The configured usage of the external ACL in squid.conf
        determines what this result means.
    
      - ![{i}](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/wiki/squidtheme/img/icon-info.png)
        the **BH** result code is only accepted by

        and newer.

  - kv-pair
    
      - One or more key=value pairs. see

### Logging

Squid sends a number of commands to the log daemon. These are sent in
the first byte of each input line:

  - 
    
    |              |                                            |
    | ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
    | L\<data\>\\n | logfile data                               |
    | R\\n         | rotate file                                |
    | T\\n         | truncate file                              |
    | O\\n         | re-open file                               |
    | F\\n         | flush file                                 |
    | r\<n\>\\n    | set rotate count to \<n\>                  |
    | b\<n\>\\n    | 1 = buffer output, 0 = don't buffer output |
    

No response is expected. Any response that may be desired should occur
on stderr to be viewed through cache.log.

### SSL certificate generation

This interface has a fixed field layout.

Input *line* received from Squid:

    request size kv-pairs [body]

![/\!\\](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/wiki/squidtheme/img/alert.png)
*line* refers to a logical input. **body** may contain \\n characters so
each line in this format is delimited by a 0x01 byte instead of the
standard \\n byte.

  - request
    
      - The type of action being requested. Presently the code
        **new\_certificate** is the only request made.

  - size
    
      - Total size of the following request bytes taken by the
        **kv-pair** parameters and **body**.

  - kv-pair
    
      - One or more key=value pairs separated by new lines. The key
        names reserved on this interface:
        
        |       |                                                     |
        | ----- | --------------------------------------------------- |
        | host= | FQDN host name of the domain needing a certificate. |
        

  - body
    
      - An optional CA certificate and private RSA key to sign with. If
        this body field is omitted the generated certificate will be
        self-signed. The content of this field is ASCII-armoured PEM
        format.
        
            -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
            ...

        and newer.
    
      - ![/\!\\](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/wiki/squidtheme/img/alert.png)
        The helper will display an error message and abort if any error
        or unexpected event is detected.

  - size
    
      - Total size of the following request bytes taken by the **body**.

  - kv-pairs
    
      - An optional list of key=value parameters separated by new lines.
        Some of the supported key=value pairs are:
        
        |       |                                                       |

### Cache file eraser

The unlink() function used to erase files is a blocking call and can
slow Squid down. This interface is used to pass file erase instructions
to a helper program specified by
[unlinkd\_program](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/unlinkd_program#).

This interface has a fixed field layout. As of
[Squid-3.3](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/AddonHelpers/Squid-3.3#)
this interface does not support concurrency. It requires Squid to be
built with **--enable-unlinkd** and only cache storage types which use
disk files (UFS, AUFS, diskd) use this interface.

Input line received from Squid:

    path

  - path
    
      - The file to be erased.

Result line sent back to Squid:

    result [kv-pair]

  - result
    
      - One of the result codes:
        
        |    |                                                |
        | -- | ---------------------------------------------- |
        | OK | Success. The file has been removed from cache. |
        | BH | Failure. The helper encountered a problem.     |
