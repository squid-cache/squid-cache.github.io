# Feature: Connection Pinning

- **Goal**: Support connection handling required for NTLM
  authentication passthrough
- **Status**: complete
- **Version**: 2.6+ and 3.1+
- **Developer**:
  [HenrikNordstrom](/HenrikNordstrom)
  (2.6), Christos Tsantilas (3.1)
- **More**: draft-jaganathan-kerberos-http-01.txt and Squid-2
  implementation;
- **More**: also
  [1632](https://bugs.squid-cache.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1632)

## Details

Connection Pinning is especially useful for proxied connections to
servers using Microsoft Integrated Login (NTLM/Negotiate), it needs:

- code to tie a client-side and a server-side socket exclusively when
  needed
- code to activate the tying when a stateful authentication layer is
  seen
- code to mark the objects downloaded over a pinned connection
  uncachable
- code to add a header advertising this capability to clients

The HTTP protocol extensions used to negotiate this is documented in
Internet Draft draft-jaganathan-kerberos-http-01.txt (a copy can be
found in doc/rfc/ in the development tree)

This feature has been implemented for the Squid-2 branch starting with
[Squid-2.6](/Releases/Squid-2.6) by
[Henrik Nordstrom](/HenrikNordstrom)
during the CodeSprintOct2005
code sprint in Torino.

This feature has been implemented for the Squid-3 branch starting with
[Squid-3.1](/Releases/Squid-3.1) by [ChristosTsantilas](/ChristosTsantilas)

    NOTE: This feature does not exist in
    [Squid-3.0](/Releases/Squid-3.0).

## Configuration Options

This feature is enabled by default in
[Squid-3.1](/Releases/Squid-3.1) and later
and makes use of the **connection-auth** option.

The option can be applied on
[http_port](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/http_port),
[https_port](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/https_port), and
[cache_peer](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/cache_peer) lines.
It controls connections either IN or OUT of those access points. If
either is disabled connection auth cannot be performed.

When used on a receiving port it can be set to ON or OFF. Default is ON.

    http_port ... connection-auth[=on|off]
    https_port ... connection-auth[=on|off]

When used on a
[cache_peer](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/cache_peer) link it
can be set to ON, OFF, or AUTO. Default is AUTO which attempts to detect
the peer capability when needed.

    cache_peer ... connection-auth[=on|off|auto]
