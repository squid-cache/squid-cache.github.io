# Details

HTTP/2 was designed loosely based on the SPDY experimental protocol for
framing HTTP requests in a multiplexed fashion over SSL connections.
Avoiding the pipeline issues which HTTP has with its dependency on
stateful "\\r\\n" frame boundaries.

HTTP/2 has some major differences however:
- HTTP/2 contains a magic connection prefix for automated protocol
    switching with HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/1.0
- Frame layout has been significantly optimized for HTTP messaging
    outside web browser usages.
- TLS is optional
- Compression algorithms have been rewoven specifically for HTTP
    performance and to avoid security vulnerabilities in gzip
    compression as used in SPDY.
- Several frame types and flow control semantics from SPDY have been
    dropped or optimized away.

Squid will support HTTP/2 formally and only support desired SPDY
features which are IEFT approved and placed in the HTTP/2 specification.

## Traffic from client to Squid

To implement a HTTP/2 receiving port in Squid we need to:
- duplicate the HTTP client connection manager (ConnStateData,
    ClientSocketContext, ClientHttpRequest class triplet)
- update the new version to decapsulate/encapsulate with HTTP/2
    framing on read/write
- update the new manager to handle multiple parallel data pipeline
    channels ("streams" in the HTTP/2 grammar). At present there is
    only one active context and an idle pipeline queue. HTTP/2
    requires a minimum of 100 in parallel.
- avoiding direct reads or writes to the client socket
    **mostly done** as of [Squid-3.2](/Releases/Squid-3.2)
    but there are a few exceptions, ie tunnel and ssl-bump.
- implement HTTP/2 header parser and packer routines
- implement the HTTP/2 compression (HPACK) algorithms:
    - string-literal encoder
    - Huffman encoder/decoder
- implement Upgrade header support:
    - for h2c label
    - for TLS/\*
- implement TLS for systems where OpenSSL is not available.
    - Including ALPN extension support
    - Possibly also NPN extension support

> :x:
    this is only required because browser manufacturers refuse once
    again to implement proxy support for HTTP/2 over port 80 or
    3128. Notable exception being MSIE which is being friendly to
    proxies.

### Progress

**Completed: (in [Squid-3.5](/Releases/Squid-3.5))**

- Solve Bug [3371](https://bugs.squid-cache.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3371)
    interference with our ability to detect and relay HTTP/2
    transparently

**Completed: (in [Squid-4](/Releases/Squid-4))**

- Implement TLS support using GnuTLS for systems where OpenSSL is not
    available.

**Completed: (in http2 branch)**

- Detection of the HTTP/2 connection header magic octets in port 80
    intercepted traffic
- Implement branching points for HTTP/2 frame parser

**Underway:**

- Parsing HTTP/2 request

## Traffic from Squid to servers

To implement a server gateway in Squid we need to:

- add a new HTTP/2.0 server connection pool similar but different to
    the HTTP/1.1 idle pconn pool
    - without timeout closures on the pool (timeout is relative to
        last use, not pooling time).
    - holding the connections which are actively in use but can be
        shared with more server requests.
    - pooling at the level of stateful connection manager object
        (`HttpStateData`
        presently) not stateless TCP connection details
        (Comm::Connection)
- duplicate the HTTP server connection manager
    - update the new version to encapsulate/decapsulate with HTTP/2
        framing on read/write
    - update the new manager to handle multiple parallel data
        pipelines.
- implement mandatory transport layer compression / decompression.
    - shared with receiving socket code, but different state tables
- implement HTTP/2 header parser and packer routines
    - shared with receiving socket code
- implement TLS for systems where OpenSSL is not available.
    - including ALPN extension support
