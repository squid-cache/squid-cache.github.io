# Feature: Customizable Error Message

- **Goal**: To alter the error pages layouts and content generated by
  Squid.
- **Status**: complete.
- **Version**: 2.1
- **Developer**: Unknown.

# Details

Squid lets you customize your error messages. The source distribution
includes error messages in different languages.

**From Squid 3.1:**

- CSS hooks are available for display redesign and coloring.
- Language translations are done by default automatically when
    language pages are installed. See [Translations Project](/Translations)
for more details on those.

For older Squid you can select the language with the configure option
*--enable-err-language=lang*.

If needed, you can make a copy and re-write the error message template
files in any version.

## deny_info URL codes for embedding

**Squid-2.1 to[Squid-3.1](/Releases/Squid-3.1)
only provide this macro code:**

- %s
:    Absolute URL requested by client

**[Squid-3.2](/Releases/Squid-3.2) adds URL templating codes:**

- %a
:   User identity
- %d  
:   seconds elapsed since request received (not yet implemented)
- %e  
:   errno
- %E  
:   strerror()
- %h  
:   Squid public hostname
- %H  
:   server host name
- %i  
:   client IP address
- %I
:   server IP address (NP: upper case **i**)
- %M  
:   Request Method
- %o  
:   Message returned by external ACL helper
- %p  
:   URL port number
- %P  
:   Protocol
- %R  
:   URL path requested.
- %S  
:   Squid version signature.
- %s  
:   Absolute URL requested by client
- %t  
:   local time
- %T  
:   UTC
- %U  
:   Absolute URL without password. Uses \* instead of path for CONNECT
    requests.
- %u  
:   Absolute URL with password. May be missing path on CONNECT requests.
- %w  
:   cachemgr email address

## ERR_\* template codes for embedding

This list describes the macro codes which Squid will replace in the
error response messages, and what details will be inserted:

- %a  
:   User identity
- %B  
:   URL with FTP %2f hack
- %c  
:   Squid error code
- %d  
:   seconds elapsed since request received (not yet implemented)
- %D  
:   Squid-generated error details. May contain other error page
    formatting codes. Currently only TLS/SSL connection failures are
    detailed. For example, %D in a customized
    *ERR_SECURE_CONNECT_FAIL* response may be expanded into "The host
    name you are connecting to (foo.com) does not match any of the
    certificate names (foo.org, foo.net)..."). Supported since
    [Squid-3.2](/Releases/Squid-3.2).
    See also: application-level error code (%x) and system level error
    code/detail (%e/%E).
- %e  
:   errno
- %E  
:   strerror()
- %f  
:   FTP request line
- %F

- %o  
:   Message returned by external acl helper
- %p  
:   URL port number
- %P  
:   Protocol
- %R  
:   Full HTTP Request
- %S  
:   squid default signature
- %s  
:   caching proxy software with version

## Custom error pages not displayed for HTTPS

HTTPS uses HTTP CONNECT messages to relay through a proxy. Due to
browser behaviour handling these CONNECT messages (described in
<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=479880>) any custom
error page produced by the proxy is ignored and a generic browser page
displayed instead.

Usually this browser page mentions connection failure or other such
irrelevant details.

In fact any response other than **200 OK** is completely dropped by the
browser and the same browser template page displayed. This can lead to
some very weird authentication problems when using HTTPS through an
authenticated proxy as well for authentication schemes where the 407
message body has relevance.
