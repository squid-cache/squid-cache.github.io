Historically, many Squid source files have been dumped into squid/src
directory. That directory has accumulated more than 400 source files.
This project will group closely related files and place groups in
individual directories. The squid/src directory will contain pretty much
nothing but Makefiles and subdirectories.

## Squid Source Code Layout

This section is used to edit and finalize the grouping of source files.
The **Group** column contains src/ subdirectory names. The **Files**
section lists current file names and assumes file extensions .h, .cc,
and .cci are added to the corresponding file names and masks.

Key:
- (empty) - not even checked yet to see if this needs doing.
- :frown: in a sad state of affairs.
- :heavy_check_mark: Done.
- :neutral_face: Improved, but needs more work. Nobody is working on this now.
  See the To-do column for details.

## Bundled Add-On Source code

This section is used to edit and finalize the grouping of source files
important for users but not integral to build Squid. These sources are
generally contributed by third parties and vetted by the Squid
Developers for bundling.

## Problems

If you know the solution or can improve the proposed one, please write
to squid-dev mailing list.

| Problem | Proposed solution |
| ------- | ----------------- |
| Where to put OS-compatibility wrappers that are currently located in squid/lib and squid/include? | squid/compat/ but due to autoconf limitations the code must still be in .c files. |
| Where to put 3rd party libraries that are currently located in squid/lib and squid/include? | squid/import/libFoo/ |
| Can we remove Foo prefix from FOO/FooSomething.h file names? The prefix carries no additional information and is probably not required for modern compilers, especially in C++ world. | Yes, Carefully <br /> File name should match the primary class declared or defined in that file. Directory name should match the (lowercased) namespace used by classes in that directory. We should move from `PROTOFoo` to `PROTO::Foo` classes. <br /> Ensure that there is no squid/src/Foo.h or squid/include/Foo.h file before using a foo/Foo.h. Some systemic problems have been found cleaning filenames like this with compiler include methods. |
| Should client- and server- side files be separated? | yes |
| Should directory names use just_small, CamelCase, or CAPS letters? | lower_case |
| Should class and file names use just_small, CamelCase, or CAPS letters? | CamelCaseHttpAcronymsIncluded |
| Should we use squid/src/squid/ root for most sources to include header files as &lt;squid/group/file.h&gt;? This may be required for installed headers and 3rd party code using those headers. It is not clear whether Squid will have installed headers in the foreseeable future. The Feature/eCAP work will determine that. | no |
| Should we form a generic mini-cache object type to combine the shared portions of fqdncache, ipcache, idns queue, netdb, ident-cache, maybe others not yet found? | Probably, that will be a separate feature event though. |
| What to do with all the mixed test*and stub_* files during this restructure? | Stub files placed next to the .cc file they can replace with an extension of .stub.cc and no file prefix.
test files go in test-suite directory. |
| What to do with third-party integration scripts and files? | Place in application-specific subdirectories off tools/ |

## Dependency Issues:

- Cache manager **storeAppendPrintf** - just about every component
    uses this old function to dump it's stats to the cache manager
    output. It depends on StoreEntry which pulls in the entire store
    component tree. We need to make it use something something smaller
    - An earlier attempt was made to use StoreEntryStream, but that
        still pulls in StoreEntry
    - MemBuf is looking like a good all-purpose buffer we can have the
        components dump their text into. Which is then dumped into a
        StoreEntry by the cache manager. TODO: this probably should be
        switched to SBuf or SBufList now.
    - Current approach is to use Packable API:
        - the **Packable** type defines basic append() and appendf()
            semantics implemented by relevant classes (MemBuf,
            StoreEntry, TODO: SBuf).
        - the **PackableStream** type implements the C++ stream
            operators for any object implementing the Packable API
- **debugs()** macro handling still has a small circular dependency
    with libsquid, libbase files and file IO.

### Testing Architecture

Per developers meeting 2023-10-25:
 - restructure src/Makefile.am to link all squid objects and libraries into libsquid.la.
 - redesign tests to link libsquid.la
 - provide distinct main.cc files for each binary, linked against libsquid.la

### Other

**Explicit initialization vs self-initialization**

    The more I think on this the more I am of the opinion that using
    self-registering static/global objects as method of initialization &
    registration is generally a mistake. Better if each such class have a
    method for initialization, with initialization order explicitly coded in
    the main program. Also makes transition to runtime loaded modules easier
    and less intrusive as each module can assume the modules it registers
    into has been properly initialized already which means it can do a full
    initialization.

    Regards
    Henrik

Current approach is to replace globals with a static function (typically
called GetFoo() or Foo::GetInstance() for the foo global) returning a
static local variable. The variable should either self-initialize or be
carefully initialized by the getter function.
