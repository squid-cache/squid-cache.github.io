# Proxying Web Traffic On A Linux Bridge Server

## Outline

This example outlines how to configure a Linux bridge to policy route
traffic (web in this instance) towards a Squid proxy.

Please realize this just gets the packets out of the bridge mode (OSI
model layer 2 packet handling) into the machines packet routing system
(layer 3); you also have to configure routing (layer 3) and interception
(layer 4) on the machine to divert traffic to the Squid TCP port\!

## Usage

Various networks are using bridge devices as gateways and wish to
implement transparent caching or content filtering.

## ebtables DROP vs iptables DROP

In iptables which in most cases is being used to filter network traffic
the DROP target means "packet disappear".

In ebtables a "-j redirect --redirect-target DROP" means "packet be gone
from the bridge into the upper layers of the kernel such as
routing\\forwarding"

Since the ebtables works in the link layer of the connection in order to
intercept the connection we must "redirect" the traffic to the level
which iptables will be able to intercept\\tproxy.

## ebtables Configuration Rules

Bridging configuration in Linux is done with the *ebtables* utility.

You also need to follow all the steps for setting up the Squid box as a
router device. These bridging rules are additional steps to move packets
from bridging mode to routing mode:
```bash
    ## interface facing clients
    CLIENT_IFACE=eth0
    
    ## interface facing Internet
    INET_IFACE=eth1
    
    
    ebtables -t broute -A BROUTING \
            -i $CLIENT_IFACE -p ipv6 --ip6-proto tcp --ip6-dport 80 \
            -j redirect --redirect-target DROP
    
    ebtables -t broute -A BROUTING \
            -i $CLIENT_IFACE -p ipv4 --ip-proto tcp --ip-dport 80 \
            -j redirect --redirect-target DROP
    
    ebtables -t broute -A BROUTING \
            -i $INET_IFACE -p ipv6 --ip6-proto tcp --ip6-sport 80 \
            -j redirect --redirect-target DROP
    
    ebtables -t broute -A BROUTING \
            -i $INET_IFACE -p ipv4 --ip-proto tcp --ip-sport 80 \
            -j redirect --redirect-target DROP
    
    
    if test -d /proc/sys/net/bridge/ ; then
      for i in /proc/sys/net/bridge/*
      do
        echo 0 > $i
      done
      unset i
    fi

 > :warning:
    The bridge interfaces also need to be configured with public IP
    addresses for Squid to use in its normal operating traffic (DNS,
    ICMP, TPROXY failed requests, peer requests, etc)
