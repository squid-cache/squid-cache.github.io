# Configuring a Squid Server to authenticate against Active Directory via Kerberos

Original work By Adrian Chadd, with updates by James Robertson on 19.01.2012
and Christopher Schirner on 11.11.2014

An alternate way to integrate with Active Directory is via Samba and [NTLM](Ntlm)

## Introduction

This wiki page covers setup of a Squid proxy which will seamlessly
integrate with Active Directory using Kerberos, NTLM and basic
authentication for clients not authenticated via Kerberos or NTLM.
> :warning:
    File paths and account user/group names will depend on
    the specific operating system setup

## Example Environment

the following examples are utilised, you should update any configuration
examples with your clients domain, hostnames, IP's etc. where necessary.

- Network
    - Domain= example.local
    - Subnet = 192.168.0.0/24
- Proxy Server
    - OS = GNU/Linux
    - Squid 3.1
    - IP = 192.168.0.10
    - HOSTNAME = squidproxy.example.local
    - Kerberos computer name = SQUIDPROXY-K
- Windows Server 1
    - IP = 192.168.0.1
    - HOSTNAME = dc1.example.local
- Windows Server 2
    - IP = 192.168.0.2
    - HOSTNAME = dc2.example.local

## Prerequisites

Client Windows Computers need to have *Enable Integrated Windows
Authentication* ticked in *Internet Options â‡’ Advanced settings*.

## DNS Configuration

On the Windows DNS server add a new A record entry for the proxy
server's hostname and ensure a corresponding PTR (reverse DNS) entry is
also created and works. Check that the proxy is using the Windows DNS
Server for name resolution and update `/etc/resolv.conf` accordingly.

Edit the file according to your network.
```
domain example.local
search example.local
nameserver 192.168.0.1
nameserver 192.168.0.2
```

Ping a internal and external hostname to ensure DNS is operating.
```
ping dc1.example.local -c 4 && ping google.com -c 4
```

Check you can reverse lookup the Windows Server and the local proxy ip
from the Windows DNS.
```
dig -x 192.168.0.1
dig -x 192.168.0.10
```

The **ANSWER SECTION** should contain the the DNS name of
`dc1.example.local` and `squidproxy.example.local`.

> :information_source: **Important:** If either lookup fails do not proceed until fixed or
authentication may fail.

## NTP Configuration

Time needs to be synchronised with Windows Domain Controllers for
authentication, configure the proxy to obtain time from them and test to
ensure they are working as expected.

## Install and Configure Kerberos

Install Kerberos packages - on Debian these are `krb5-user libkrb53`

Edit the file `/etc/krb5.conf` replacing the variables with the your
domain and servers.

> :information_source: **Important:** If you only have 1 Domain Controller remove the
additional `kdc` entry from the `[realms]` section, or add any
additional DC's.

Depending on your Domain Controller's OS Version uncomment the relevant
Windows 200X section and comment out the opposing section.

```
[libdefaults]
    default_realm = EXAMPLE.LOCAL
    dns_lookup_kdc = no
    dns_lookup_realm = no
    ticket_lifetime = 24h
    default_keytab_name = /etc/squid3/PROXY.keytab

; for Windows 2003
    default_tgs_enctypes = rc4-hmac des-cbc-crc des-cbc-md5
    default_tkt_enctypes = rc4-hmac des-cbc-crc des-cbc-md5
    permitted_enctypes = rc4-hmac des-cbc-crc des-cbc-md5

; for Windows 2008 with AES
;    default_tgs_enctypes = aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96 rc4-hmac des-cbc-crc des-cbc-md5
;    default_tkt_enctypes = aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96 rc4-hmac des-cbc-crc des-cbc-md5
;    permitted_enctypes = aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96 rc4-hmac des-cbc-crc des-cbc-md5

[realms]
    EXAMPLE.LOCAL = {
        kdc = dc1.example.local
        kdc = dc2.example.local
        admin_server = dc1.example.local
        default_domain = example.local
    }

[domain_realm]
    .example.local = EXAMPLE.LOCAL
    example.local = EXAMPLE.LOCAL
```

> :information_source: **Important notice:** One should use "Windows 2008 with AES" if
available. This is not just important for security reasons, but you
might also experience problems when using the DNS name of the squid
server instead of the IP address.

Example error messages regarding this issue may look like this:
```
ERROR: Negotiate Authentication validating user. Error returned 'BH gss_accept_sec_context() failed: Unspecified GSS failure.  Minor code may provide more information.'
```

## Install Squid 3

We install squid 3 now as we need the squid3 directories available.
Squid configuration takes places after authentication is configured. On
Debian install the `squid3 ldap-utils` packages.

## Authentication

The Proxy uses 4 methods to authenticate clients, Negotiate/Kerberos,
Negotiate/NTLM, NTLM and basic authentication. Markus Moellers
negotiate_wrapper is used for the 2 Negotiate methods.

### Kerberos

Kerberos utilises msktutil an Active Directory keytab manager (I presume
the name is abbreviated for "Microsoft Keytab Utility"). We need to
install some packages that msktutil requires. On Debian install
`libsasl2-modules-gssapi-mit libsasl2-modules`

Install msktutil - you can find msktutil here
"<http://fuhm.net/software/msktutil/releases/>"

Initiate a kerberos session to the server with administrator permissions
to add objects to AD, update the username where necessary. msktutil will
use it to create our kerberos computer object in Active directory.

    kinit administrator

It should return without errors. You can see if you successfully obtained
a ticket with:

    klist

Now we configure the proxy's kerberos computer account and service
principle by running msktutil (remember to update the values with
yours).

> :warning: **Important:** There are 2 important caveats in regard to the msktutils
--computer-name argument:
    - `-computer-name` cannot be longer than 15 characters due to netbios name
        limitations. See this link and this link for further information.
    - `-computer-name` must be different from the proxy's hostname so computer
        account password updates for NTLM and Kerberos do not conflict, see this
        [link](http://www.squid-cache.org/mail-archive/squid-users/201112/0461.html)
        for further information. This guide uses -k appended to the hostname.


Execute the msktutil command as follows:
```
msktutil -c -b "CN=COMPUTERS" -s HTTP/squidproxy.example.local -k /etc/squid3/PROXY.keytab \
    --computer-name SQUIDPROXY-K --upn HTTP/squidproxy.example.local --server dc1.example.local --verbose
```

> :information_source: If you are using a Server 2008 domain then add
    `--enctypes 28` at the end of the command


Pay attention to the output of the command to ensure success, because we
are using --verbose output you should review it carefully.

Set the permissions on the keytab so squid can read it.
```
chgrp proxy /etc/squid3/PROXY.keytab
chmod g+r /etc/squid3/PROXY.keytab
```

Destroy the administrator credentials used to create the account.

    kdestroy

On the Windows Server reset the Computer Account in AD by right clicking
on the SQUIDPROXY-K Computer object and select "Reset Account", then run
msktutil as follows to ensure the keytab is updated as expected and that
the keytab is being sourced by msktutil from `/etc/krb5.conf` correctly.
This is not completely necessary but is useful to ensure msktutil works
as expected. Then run the following:

    msktutil --auto-update --verbose --computer-name squidproxy-k

> :information_source: Even though the account was added in capital letters, the
    `--auto-update` in msktutil requires the `--computer-name` to be lower
    case.

If the keytab is not found try adding `-k /etc/squid3/PROXY.keytab` to
the command to see if it works and then troubleshoot until resolved or
users will not be able to authenticate with Squid.

Add the following to cron so it can automatically updates the computer
account in active directory when it expires (typically 30 days). Pipe it
through logger so I can see any errors in syslog if necessary. As stated
msktutil uses the default `/etc/krb5.conf` file for its parameters so be
aware of that if you decide to make any changes in it.

    00 4  *   *   *     msktutil --auto-update --verbose --computer-name squidproxy-k | logger -t msktutil

Edit squid3's init script to export the `KRB5_KTNAME` variable so squid
knows where to find the kerberos keytab.

On Debian the simplest way to do that is as follows:

Add the following configuration to `/etc/default/squid3`

    KRB5_KTNAME=/etc/squid3/PROXY.keytab
    export KRB5_KTNAME

### NTLM

Install Samba and Winbind. On Debian install `samba winbind samba-common-bin`

Stop the samba and winbind daemons and edit `/etc/samba/smb.conf`
```
workgroup = EXAMPLE
security = ads
realm = EXAMPLE.LOCAL

winbind uid = 10000-20000
winbind gid = 10000-20000
winbind use default domain = yes
winbind enum users = yes
winbind enum groups = yes
```

Now join the proxy to the domain.
```
net ads join -U Administrator
```
Start samba and winbind and test access to the domain.
```
wbinfo -t
```

This command should output something like this:
```
checking the trust secret for domain EXAMPLE via RPC calls succeeded

wbinfo -a EXAMPLE\\testuser%'password'
```

Output should be similar to this.

    plaintext password authentication succeeded
    challenge/response password authentication succeeded

Set Permissions so the proxy user account can read
`/var/run/samba/winbindd_privileged`

```
gpasswd -a proxy winbindd_priv
```

> - :warning: on Debian an Ubuntu systems there may also be a
    `/var/lib/samba/winbindd_privileged` directory created by the
    winbind and ntlm_auth tools with root ownership. The group of that
    folder needs to be changed to match the
    `/var/run/samba/winbindd_privileged` location.

append the following to cron to regularly change the computer account
password (Samba might do this automatically, check Samba documentation)
```
    05  4  *   *   *     net rpc changetrustpw -d 1 | logger -t changetrustpw
```

### Basic

In order to use basic authentication by way of LDAP we need to create an
account with which to access Active Directory.

In Active Directory create a user called "Squid Proxy" with the logon
name <squid@example.local>.

Ensure the following is true when creating the account:
- User must change password at next logon Unticked
- User cannot change password Ticked
- Password never expires Ticked
- Account is disabled Unticked

Create a password file used by squid for ldap access and secure the file
permissions (substitute the word "squidpass" below with your password).
```
echo 'squidpass' > /etc/squid3/ldappass.txt
chmod o-r /etc/squid3/ldappass.txt
chgrp proxy /etc/squid3/ldappass.txt
```

## Install negotiate_wrapper

Firstly we need to install negotiate_wrapper. Install the necessary
build tools on Debian install `build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)`
Then compile and install.

```bash
cd /usr/local/src/
wget "http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/squidkerbauth/negotiate_wrapper/negotiate_wrapper-1.0.1/negotiate_wrapper-1.0.1.tar.gz"
tar -xvzf negotiate_wrapper-1.0.1.tar.gz
cd negotiate_wrapper-1.0.1/
./configure
make
make install
```

## squid.conf

Then setup squid and it's associated config files.

Add the following to your `squid.conf`.

Study and update the following text carefully, replacing the example
content with your networks configuration - if you get something wrong
your proxy will not work.

```
### /etc/squid3/squid.conf Configuration File ####
