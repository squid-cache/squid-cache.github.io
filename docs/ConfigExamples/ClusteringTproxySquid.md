# Clustering Tproxy Squid With Linux Router

by *Eliezer Croitoru*

## Linux router and WCCP

WCCP stands for
[Web Cache Communication Protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Cache_Communication_Protocol)

What is good about WCCP? WCCP allows web cache clustering with built in
fail-over mechanism and semi auto configuration management.

It gives the Network administrator quiet in mind that if something in
the cache cluster is not functioning the clients will not suffer from it.

WCCP can be implemented for http and other protocols. many Network
administrator will implement the Web cache infrastructure close to the
edge of the network to gain bandwidth,

Some cache architectures built to cooperate with the edge routing
system: Peerapp exinda F5-sol1880

if you do use Cisco you can use WCCP but in other cases such as If you
are using Linux router As edge Router server\\BGP\\Route reflector it's
another story. Even Vyatta the leading Open-source routing platform dont
have support for WCCP.

To implement Web cache on the edge you need to throw some routing and
iptables rules.

## Outline

I will give a simple scenario and some basic rules and baselines.

In linux routing we have a "main" and "local" routing table for all
traffic. "Local" is for psychically connected devices and "main" is for
all other destinations.

There is a very good feature in linux routing system that allows custom
Routing Tables. The idea is that based on "ip rules" we can define
specific packets by "src" "dst" "dev" and "fwmark" to be routed
specifically as we want.

It can be via specific up-link\\port or in our case Cache
proxy\\cluster.

Compared to the CLI of cisco or juniper it can seem like annoying or
joke to some but Linux has a very low limit on pps and there for very
powerful.

- the cache proxy clusters can sit in a private network despite the
    fact they serve public addressees.
- it is involving natting so take a moment to think about the
    cost.

We will configure the linux router to mark all web (port 80) traffic(out
to the net and back). based on the mark we will forward all the traffic
using routing rule to specific "cache" table. The cache table consist of
the list of cache proxy available. The routes in the table will be load
balanced using _RoundRobin_
Algorithm. (later i will maybe will do something more sophisticated)

## Topology

On the network:

- all the routing on the edge router is managed VIA routing
  Daemon(Bird).
- all the cache proxies have routing Daemon connected to the edge
  routers to choose the right path\\gw.

## Basic assumptions on you

You know the difference between TPROXY and intercept mode of squid.

you do know basic/advanced Networking.

you do have experience using iptables iproute2(ip) and know a thing or
two about routing Daemons(Quagga,Openbgpd,Bird)

## Linux Edge Configuration

Since we will use iptables you must understand we will \*NOT\* by any
way use connection tracking\!\! the only layer we will use is IP\\Layer
3 filtering. the only iptables modules needed for the task on the router
are:

    ip_tables
    iptable_mangle
    iptable_filter
    x_tables
    xt_mark

You must load them manually to avoid auto-loading of other modules.

Requirements on ubuntu: Basic ubuntu server ships with iptunnel iproute2
and all iptables modules needed for the task.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/bash

echo "Loading modules.."
modprobe -a nf_tproxy_core xt_TPROXY xt_socket xt_mark ip_gre gre


LOCALIP="10.80.2.2"
CISCODIRIP="10.80.2.1"
CISCOIPID="192.168.10.127"

echo "changing routing and reverse path stuff.."
echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/lo/rp_filter
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

echo "creating tunnel..."
iptunnel add wccp0 mode gre remote $CISCOIPID local $LOCALIP dev eth1
ifconfig wccp0 127.0.1.1/32 up

echo "creating routing table for tproxy..."
ip rule add fwmark 1 lookup 100
ip route add local 0.0.0.0/0 dev lo table 100

echo "creating iptables tproxy rules..."
iptables -A INPUT  -i lo -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT  -p icmp -m icmp --icmp-type any -j ACCEPT
iptables -A FORWARD -i lo -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT  -s $CISCODIRIP -p udp -m udp --dport 2048 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -i wccp0 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p gre -j ACCEPT

iptables -t mangle -F
iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -d $LOCALIP -j ACCEPT
iptables -t mangle -N DIVERT
iptables -t mangle -A DIVERT -j MARK --set-mark 1
iptables -t mangle -A DIVERT -j ACCEPT
iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp -m socket -j DIVERT
iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j TPROXY --tproxy-mark 0x1/0x1 --on-port 3129
```

add into squid.conf the next lines:

    #add change the src subnet to the list of clients subnets allowed.
    acl clients src 10.80.0.0/16

    http_access allow clients

    http_port 127.0.0.1:3128
    http_port 3129 tproxy

    # replace 10.80.2.1 with your cisco router directly connected interface
    wccp2_router 10.80.2.1
    wccp_version 2
    wccp2_rebuild_wait on
    wccp2_forwarding_method 1
    wccp2_return_method 1
    wccp2_service standard 0
    wccp2_service dynamic 80
    wccp2_service dynamic 90
    wccp2_service_info 80 protocol=tcp flags=src_ip_hash priority=240 ports=80
    wccp2_service_info 90 protocol=tcp flags=dst_ip_hash,ports_source priority=240 ports=80

## Cisco settings

    conf t

    ip access-list extended wccp
     permit ip 10.80.3.0 0.0.0.255 any
    ip access-list extended wccp_to_inside
     permit ip any 10.80.3.0 0.0.0.255
    exit
    ip wccp version 2
    ip wccp web-cache
    ip wccp 80 redirect-list wccp
    ip wccp 90 redirect-list wccp_to_inside

    interface FastEthernet0/0
     ip wccp 80 redirect out
     ip wccp 90 redirect in

    interface FastEthernet0/1
     ip wccp redirect exclude in

## Building Squid

Squid must have been built with these options to ./configure

    --enable-linux-netfilter --enable-wccpv2
