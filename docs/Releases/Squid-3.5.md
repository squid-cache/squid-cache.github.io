## Open Bugs

  - :frowning:
    [Major or higher Bugs currently affecting this
    release](http://bugs.squid-cache.org/buglist.cgi?bug_id_type=anyexact&bug_severity=blocker&bug_severity=critical&bug_severity=major&bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&chfieldto=Now&product=Squid&query_format=advanced&columnlist=bug_severity%2Cversion%2Cop_sys%2Cshort_desc&order=version%20DESC%2Cbug_severity%2Cbug_id&o2=equals&v2=unspecified&f1=version&o1=lessthaneq&v1=3.5).
    
      - Bugs against any older version can be closed if found fixed in
        3.5.
    
      - Bugs inherited from older versions are not necessarily blockers
        on 3.5 stable.

## Squid-3.5 default config

From 3.5 a few performance improvements have been done. The manager
regex ACLs have been moved after the DoS and protocol smuggling attack
protections.
