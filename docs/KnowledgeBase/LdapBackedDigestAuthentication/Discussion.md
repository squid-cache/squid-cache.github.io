See [Discussed
Page](/KnowledgeBase/LdapBackedDigestAuthentication)

A basic authorization mechanism can be implemented using digest auth.

Similar to session helper with ACTIVE loging we can redirect all http
non-authorized traffic to a digest authenticated "LOGIN" by IP service.

It is much more secure then basic auth or a simple user password form.

The other option is to use ssl encrypted page for ip authorization.
