# Optimal COSS Parameters

> :warning:
    This article is a **STUB**. It's written to encourage discussion on 
    he topic, but it's not (yet) to be used as reference |

## Synopsis

[COSS](/Features/CyclicObjectStorageSystem)
or Cyclic Object Storage System is the fastest disk storage method
available to Squid. The [SquidFaq](/SquidFaq)
contains information about its configurable parameters, while here we
want to focus on how to optimize those parameters for a typical proxying
setup for maximum performance.

**cache_dir number and parameters**

Not more than one per physical disk. The aim of COSS is to be extremely
fast, and to keep the OS - which is generally optimized for interactive
tasks - from optimizing things the wrong way. Having multiple
cache_dirs would increase the chance of disk head trashing, and thus
lower performance.

If your disks are similar in performance, it's best to just let squid
balance the load and use the same configuration parameters for all
cache_dir's.

**parameters**

Use the cachemgr to fine-tune those parameters you can tweak.
