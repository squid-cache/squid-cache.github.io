# Most Current Squid Benchmarks

Speed and Requirement details of squid are a little hard to come by at
present. Here is a list of the community contributed achievements.

If you are running any release of squid and can provide the same details
with a better requests-per-second than one listed we would like to know
about it.

Sorted by Squid Release and CPU.

## Method of Calculation

There is no good fixed benchmark test yet to measure by so comparisons
are not strictly correct. Here is how the follow details are calculated:

  - At an administrator estimated peak traffic time run **squidclient
    mgr:info** or otherwise pull the info report from **cachemgr.cgi**

| --- | --- |
| Users     | Maximum value seen for **Number of clients accessing cache** |
| RPS       | Add all number for **Average \*\*\* requests per minute since start** together and divide by 60 for per-second |
| Hit Ratio | Values of **Request Hit Ratios**: 5min - 60min . Only total hit ratio matters here. disk and memory hit ratios are highly specific to the amount of RAM available. |
| CPU Load  | It can be extracted from the **general runtime information** or **info** cachemgr page. It's the value marked "CPU Usage" |

## Records

### Squid trunk revno 13251

| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| CPU       | 4-core Intel Xeon E5-2670 @ 2.60GHz, paravirtualized (Xen) |
| RAM       | 4 Gb                                                       |
| HDD       | SSD                                                        |
| OS        | Ubuntu Saucy                                               |
| Users     | 1 user in a controlled test environment                    |
| RPS       | 39715                                                      |
| Hit Ratio | 100%                                                       |
| CPU Usage | 3 cores at 100%                                            |
| Bandwidth | 313 Mbit/sec sustained                                     |

This number was taken in a **controlled test environment**. It has
nothing to do with the numbers someone would get in a production
environment; it's just an estimate of how fast squid can be. Squid was
configured to do no logging, no access control, and apachebench was used
to hammer squid asking 10M times for a static, cachable, 600-bytes long
document. Of the 4 cores, 3 were running a multi-worker squid, one was
running ab over the loopback interface.

We have to handle mostly very, very small files which is
a real pain. So COSS was my white knight to handle this.

Although we don't use CARP we made sure that the proxies always get the
same requests. We have at our prime time about 40 MBit/s outgoing
traffic which makes about 1000 requests per second.

Also I should mention that we use a standard Debian kernel with no
tuning in any kernel parameters except the following two:

    net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 4096
    vm.swappiness = 0

helper runs http queries against one reverse proxy which

This number was taken in a **controlled test environment**. It has
nothing to do with the numbers someone would get in a production
environment; it's just an estimate of how fast squid can be. Squid was
configured to do no logging and apachebench was used to hammer squid
asking 250K times for a blocked url (leading to a 403 response with a
location header) or with a cachable, 16KB long document. Of the 4
cores, 2 were running a multi-worker squid. The apache benchmark was run
from another host and from the same host with similar results.
