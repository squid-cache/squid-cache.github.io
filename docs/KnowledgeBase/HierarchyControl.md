# Hierarchy Control

## Synopsis

Squid offers various mechanisms to control how requests are forwarded.
The most important are `never_direct`, `always_direct` and
`hierarchy_stoplist`. They interact with each other and with a request's
implicit characteristics to determine how a request will eventually be
satisfied.

**The Steps**

The various directives are evaluated in this order:

1. `always_direct`
:     if it matches as *allow*, go to origin
1. `never_direct`
:     if it matches as *allow*, go to a parent instead of origin in
        the cases below
1. `hierarchy_stoplist`
:     if it matches as *allow*, go to origin
1. determine if a request is hierarchic
:     if it is, check whether siblings or parents have the object via
      cache digests or ICP. In case of hit, ask the fastest among
      those hiting for the object
1. go to origin

**What makes a request hierarchic**

The purpose of cache hierarchy is to maximize the chance of finding
objects in siblings, so a set of heuristics is applied to try and
determine in advance whether an object is likely to be cachable. A few
objects are **not** cachable, and are thus **not** hierarchic. Those
are:

  - reload requests
  - cache validations with non-Squid ICP peers
  - requests for HTTP methods other than `GET`, `HEAD` or `TRACE`
  - authenticated requests
