# HTTP header parsing problems

## Symptoms

- `WARNING: unparseable HTTP header field {...}`
- `WARNING: unparseable HTTP header field {HTTP/1.0 200 OK}`

## Explanation

The client or server has sent Squid a header which does not comply with
the HTTP protocol standards. HTTP headers are plain text and have the
format **Name: values**. The quoted value inside {} brackets is what
Squid was given.

Set [relaxed_header_parser](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/relaxed_header_parser)
to **warn** (or **off**) for more detailed diagnostics of the problem.

## Examples

This broken server (or script) is sending two replies.
But it fails to send the reply separator between them. So Squid believe the start
of the second reply is just another header in the first:

    2005/04/13 22:44:17| WARNING: unparseable HTTP header field {HTTP/1.0 200 OK}
    2005/04/13 22:44:17| in {Server: .
    Content-type: text/html
    Date: Wed, 13 Apr 2005 20:45:40 GMT
    Connection: close
    HTTP/1.0 200 OK
    Server: .
    Content-type: text/html
    Connection: close
    }

This broken software is having the same problem. Although it is
mangling the body data into the headers. The garbage you see here is
some form of serialized data.


    2005/09/11 23:19:36| WARNING: unparseable HTTP header field {N*!!!PT!!!U_~~~~~~8OQVn8PP>0!!!NB!!!)2~!!!1t!!!7T!!!<^~!#Ds0*E[XF![(N*!!!PT!!!U_~~~~~~8OQVn8PP>0 !!!NB!!!)<~!!!1t!!!7T!!!<^~! 

## Workaround

- Fix the software sending this header. if you cannot do that yourself
    report it to the broken server or client software authors please.
    This used to be a big problem around 2005 but has become less common
    now that all the middleware proxies dump these requests. The authors
    need to be informed ASAP about what is happening so they can get
    their sites or agents working.
- NOTE: Bypassing the proxy without informing anyone is not a useful
    fix. Your client will be facing connection issues which are hard to
    determine from their end. They will still face the same problem from
    other software around the Internet.
