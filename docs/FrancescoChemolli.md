# Francesco Chemolli

I'm involved with squid development since 2000, I've been working mainly
in the autentication area and on integration with Microsoft windows
authentication systems.

Besides this, I'm a general nag-person for the other developers and I'm
the person who's most involved in caring for the project's infrastructure,
including [the wiki](https://wiki.squid-cache.org), the
[CI/CD farm](https://build.squid-cache.org),
the [website](https://www.squid-cache.org), mailing lists etc
