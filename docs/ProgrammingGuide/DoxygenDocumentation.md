# Doxygen documentation guidelines and standards

This is a **proposal** for a standard Doxygen documentation format and
template. The aim is to allow documentation writers to focus on
documentation and not on Doxygen format and semantics, and to help them
not to get in the way of code readability.

## Entities to be documented

There are several types of entities to be documented: **types**,
**variables** (both global and members), **classes**, **class methods**,
**functions**, and **components**.

- Types  
    should only be documented with be brief one-liner if possible.
- Variables  
    should be documented at their point of declaration. Inside the class
    for members, the .h for public globals, or the .cc for private
    globals.
- Classes
    should be documented in their respective header file, just before
    their declaration.
- Class Methods
    should be documented inside the class where they are declared. Must
    have named parameters identical to those used in the .cc
- Functions
    should be documented in the .h when declared in one. Functions only
    declared *privately* in the .cc should be documented in the
    implementation file, before their respective body. Must have named
    parameters identical to those used in the .cc
- Components
    Includes additional documentation information, such as component API
    object groups, and component state flow diagrams etc, this
    documentation has more complex requirements. see below

## Documentation format

Use c-style comments, prepending each line with an asterisk, and
latex-style commands. Each block should be divided in sections,
separated by an empty line. Start each block with a brief description.
E.g.:
```c++
    /** Brief description goes here (single-line, less than 78 chars)
     *
     * Long description. May span multiple lines. Avoid repeating the brief
     * description if possible, leave empty if the brief description is
     * sufficient to document the documented entity's purpose, preconditions,
     * side-effects etc.
     *
     * \command arguments etc. May span multiple lines
     * \command arguments group commands by type
     * \othercommand arguments etc.
     *
     * \yetanothercommand some entities may require more than one documentation block
     */
```

## Templates

All commands are really optional, but when used PLEASE group them as
here shown. Square brackets show optional arguments, ellipses (...) mark
optional repetitions. **DO NOT** use HTML formatting codes (or any kind
of formatting code for that matter). Stick to the basics.

The only special code to be possibly used is lists, which use syntax

```
 - unordered list item 1
 - unordered list item 2
 - unordered list item 3
```

or

``` 
 -# numbered list item 1
 -# numbered list item 2
 -# numbered list item 3
```

### Class documentation template

```c++
    /** Class handling activity X
     *
     * This class handles activity highly-critical asynchronous activity X.
     * It needs to be registered in registry Foo from the main entry point X.
     * After that it will respond to events Bar and possibly invoke Gazonk.
     *
     * \ingroup ParentGroupLabel
     */
```

### Function / Class Method documentation template

```c++
    /** Function handling activity Y
     *
     * This function does activity Y, requiring blah blah blah.
     * End with an empty line.
     * [\note particular information]
     *
     * \param paramName paramDesc
     * ...
     * \return returnValueDesc
     * \retval special-return-value return-value-desc
     * ...
     * \throw exceptionName exceptionCondition
     * ...
     * \pre precondition(s)
     * ...
     * \post postcondition(s)
     * ...
     *
     * \warning bad behaviour in unexpected cases
     * ...
     * \bug unexpected behaviour when
     * ...
     * \deprecated from version X, use otherCall instead
     * \todo if the function needs changing
     * ...
     * \see otherReferences
     */
```

## Component Documentation

> :information_source:
    For simplicity, its not worth doing much component documentation
    until after the [Features/SourceLayout](/Features/SourceLayout)
    alterations have been done to a component. After which the following
    applies...

Each component in squid is going to be in its own library. Documentation
for the component should be included in the src/subfolder for that
library. The sections which must be included are:

- API  
    this is the definition of the component *group* for collating the
    classes, functions, and globals provided. Followed by an overview of
    the library API and how it should be used. Do not include details of
    specific functions, their docs will cover that.
- Component Flow  
    high-level abstracted description of what the state flow around this
    component is meant to be, and a definition of the internals group.

### Component Documentation template

The component documentation being much longer and more detailed than
most may be written in detailed doxygen format using features such as
sections and headers. Here is a template for such a component:

```c++
    /**
    \defgroup ComponentName Component Name
    
    \defgroup ComponentNameAPI Component Name API
    \ingroup ComponentName
    
    \section Terminology Terminology
    
    - \b Foo: this is a glossary section for component-specific terms.
    - \b Blah: a blah is a fake word used in this documentation.
    - \b Foo:  another fake word, usually representing something
    
    
    \section API API overview
    
    Very abstracted overview description of the API.
    Should be enough for someone to understand the API and be able to find
    the specific functions they want for more detailed documentation.
    
    Do not repeat or go into details covered by any function documentation.
    
    
    \defgroup ComponentNameInternals Component Name Internals
    \ingroup ComponentName
    
    \section StateFlow State Flow
    
    Detailed description of any state low that may occur.
    For example the protocol components contain a high-level sequence
    of request states and the output reply states that those requests may become.
    This section may even have links to flow diagrams and other more complicated stuff
    
    It's a long description. May span multiple lines and paragraphs. Avoid repeating stuff
    if possible use references or object by exact Class::someMethod(char *p) declaration
    of if you really have to use \include Class::someMethod(char *p) to pull that objects
    docs in cleanly.
    
     */

```
This is all written up in a \*.dox file inside the component sub-folder.
