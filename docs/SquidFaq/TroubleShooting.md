# What to do when Squid misbehaves

If your Squid version is older than 2.6 it is very outdated. Many of the
issues experienced in those versions are now fixed in 2.6 and later.

Your first point of troubleshooting should be to test with a newer
*supported* release and resolve any remaining issues with that install.

Current releases can be retrieved from
<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions> or your operating system
distributor. How to do this is outlined in the system-specific help
pages.

Additional problems and resolutions for your specific system may be
found in the system-specific help troubleshooting:

1. [CentOS](/KnowledgeBase/CentOS)
2. [Debian](/KnowledgeBase/Debian)
3. [Fedora](/KnowledgeBase/)
4. [Fink](/KnowledgeBase/Fink)
5. [Gentoo](/KnowledgeBase/Gentoo)
7. [NetBSD](/KnowledgeBase/NetBSD)
8. [OpenSUSE](/KnowledgeBase/OpenSUSE)
9. [RedHat](/KnowledgeBase/RedHat)
12. [Ubuntu](/KnowledgeBase/Ubuntu)

Some common situations have their own detailed explanations and
workarounds:

## Why am I getting "Proxy Access Denied?"

You may need to set up the *http_access* option to allow requests from
your IP addresses. Please see [SquidAcl](/SquidFaq/SquidAcl)
for information about that.

Alternately, you may have misconfigured one of your ACLs. Check the
*access.log* and *squid.conf* files for clues.

## Connection Refused when reaching a sibling

I get *Connection Refused* when the cache tries to retrieve an object
located on a sibling, even though the sibling thinks it delivered the
object to my cache.

If the HTTP port number is wrong but the ICP port is correct you will
send ICP queries correctly and the ICP replies will fool your cache into
thinking the configuration is correct but large objects will fail since
you don't have the correct HTTP port for the sibling in your
*squid.conf* file. If your sibling changed their *http_port*, you could
have this problem for some time before noticing.

## Running out of filedescriptors

If you see the *Too many open files* error message, you are most likely
running out of file descriptors. This may be due to running Squid on an
operating system with a low filedescriptor limit. This limit is often
configurable in the kernel or with other system tuning tools. There are
two ways to run out of file descriptors: first, you can hit the
per-process limit on file descriptors. Second, you can hit the system
limit on total file descriptors for all processes.

> :information_source: Squid 3.x provide a ./configure option --with-filedescriptors=N

> :x:
    Even with Squid built to support large numbers of FD and the system
    configuration default set to permit large numbers to be used. The
    ulimit or equivalent tools can change those limits under Squid at
    any time. Before reporting this as a problem or bug please carefully
    check your startup scripts and any tools used to run or manage Squid
    to discover if they are setting a low FD limit.

## Linux

Linux kernel 2.2.12 and later supports "unlimited" number of open files
without patching. So does most of glibc-2.1.1 and later (all areas
touched by Squid is safe from what I can tell, even more so in later
glibc releases). But you still need to take some actions as the kernel
defaults to only allow processes to use up to 1024 filedescriptors, and
Squid picks up the limit at build time.

- Before configuring Squid run `ulimit -HS -n XXXX` (where
    XXXX is the number of filedescriptors you need to support). Be
    sure to run `make clean` before configure if you have already run
    configure as the script might otherwise have cached the prior
    result.
- Configure, build and install Squid as usual
- Make sure your script for starting Squid contains the above *ulimit*
    command to raise the filedescriptor limit. You may also need to
    allow a larger port span for outgoing connections (set in
    */proc/sys/net/ipv4/*, like in
    `echo 1024 32768 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range`)

>  :warning:
    NOTE that the **-n** option is separate from the **-HS** options.
    ulimit will fail on some systems if you try to combine them.
Alternatively you can

- Run configure with your needed configure options
- edit include/autoconf.h and define SQUID_MAXFD to your desired
    limit. Make sure to make it a nice and clean modulo 64 value
    (multiple of 64) to avoid various bugs in the libc headers.
- build and install Squid as usual
- Set the runtime ulimit as described above when starting Squid.

If running things as root is not an option then get your sysadmin to
install a the needed ulimit command in /etc/inittscript (see man
initscript), install a patched kernel where INR_OPEN in
include/linux/fs.h is changed to at least the amount you need or have
them install a small suid program which sets the limit (see link below).

## FreeBSD

> :rage:
    This information is outdated, and may no longer be relevant.

_Eliezer Croitoru_:
Referencing to [Tuning Kernel Limits](https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/configtuning-kernel-limits.html)
of the FreeBSD based on Adrian Chadd
[article](http://adrianchadd.blogspot.co.il/2013/08/why-oh-why-am-i-seeing-rst-frames-from.html).

- The docs describes that the basic "server accept" socket is bounded
    to a queue of 128 connections.
- You would probably see something like "connection reset by peer" and
    you will need to increase the *kern.ipc.somaxconn* to 2048 to match
    something useful for production network of about 300 users.
- In a case you have a loaded server you would need to increase it
    past the 16384 limit.


## General BSD

> :rage:
    This information is outdated, and may no longer be relevant.

For most BSD-derived systems (SunOS, 4.4BSD, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD,
BSD/OS, 386BSD, Ultrix) you can also use the "brute force" method to
increase these values in the kernel (requires a kernel rebuild):

- How do I check my maximum filedescriptors?
    - Do *pstat -T* and look for the *files* value, typically
        expressed as the ratio of *current*maximum.
- How do I increase them the easy way?
    - One way is to increase the value of the *maxusers* variable in
        the kernel configuration file and build a new kernel. This
        method is quick and easy but also has the effect of increasing a
        wide variety of other variables that you may not need or want
        increased.
- Is there a more precise method?
    - Another way is to find the *param.c* file in your kernel build
        area and change the arithmetic behind the relationship between
        *maxusers* and the maximum number of open files.

Here are a few examples which should lead you in the right direction:


### FreeBSD (from the 2.1.6 kernel)

> :rage:
    This information is outdated, and may no longer be relevant.

Very similar to SunOS, edit */usr/src/sys/conf/param.c* and alter the
relationship between *maxusers* and the *maxfiles* and *maxfilesperproc*
variables:

    int     maxfiles = NPROC*2;
    int     maxfilesperproc = NPROC*2;

Where *NPROC* is defined by: *\#define NPROC (20 + 16 \* MAXUSERS)* The
per-process limit can also be adjusted directly in the kernel
configuration file with the following directive: *options OPEN_MAX=128*

### BSD/OS (from the 2.1 kernel)

> :rage:
    This information is outdated, and may no longer be relevant.

Edit */usr/src/sys/conf/param.c* and adjust the *maxfiles* math here:

    int     maxfiles = 3 * (NPROC + MAXUSERS) + 80;

Where *NPROC* is defined by: *\#define NPROC (20 + 16 \* MAXUSERS)* You
should also set the *OPEN_MAX* value in your kernel configuration file
to change the per-process limit.

## Reconfigure afterwards

> :rage:
    This information is outdated, and may no longer be relevant.

After you rebuild/reconfigure your kernel with more filedescriptors, you
must then recompile Squid. Squid's configure script determines how many
filedescriptors are available, so you must make sure the configure
script runs again as well. For example:

    cd squid-1.1.x
    make realclean
    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/squid
    make

## What are these strange lines about removing objects?

For example:

    97/01/23 22:31:10| Removed 1 of 9 objects from bucket 3913
    97/01/23 22:33:10| Removed 1 of 5 objects from bucket 4315
    97/01/23 22:35:40| Removed 1 of 14 objects from bucket 6391

These log entries are normal, and do not indicate that *squid* has
reached *cache_swap_high*.

Consult your cache information page in *cachemgr.cgi* for a line like
this:

    Storage LRU Expiration Age:     364.01 days

Objects which have not been used for that amount of time are removed as
a part of the regular maintenance. You can set an upper limit on the
*LRU Expiration Age* value with *reference_age* in the config file.

## Can I change a Windows NT FTP server to list directories in Unix format?

Why, yes you can! Select the following menus:

- Start
- Programs
- Microsoft Internet Server (Common)
- Internet Service Manager

This will bring up a box with icons for your various services. One of
them should be a little ftp "folder." Double click on this.

You will then have to select the server (there should only be one)
Select that and then choose "Properties" from the menu and choose the
"directories" tab along the top.

There will be an option at the bottom saying "Directory listing style."
Choose the "Unix" type, not the "MS-DOS" type.

by *Oskar Pearson*

## Why am I getting "Ignoring MISS from non-peer x.x.x.x?"

You are receiving ICP MISSes (via UDP) from a parent or sibling cache
whose IP address your cache does not know about. This may happen in two
situations.

If the peer is multihomed, it is sending packets out an interface which
is not advertised in the DNS. Unfortunately, this is a configuration
problem at the peer site. You can tell them to either add the IP address
interface to their DNS, or use Squid's "udp_outgoing_address" option
to force the replies out a specific interface. For example: *on your
parent squid.conf:*

    udp_outgoing_address proxy.parent.com

*on your squid.conf:*

    cache_peer proxy.parent.com parent 3128 3130

You can also see this warning when sending ICP queries to multicast
addresses. For security reasons, Squid requires your configuration to
list all other caches listening on the multicast group address. If an
unknown cache listens to that address and sends replies, your cache will
log the warning message. To fix this situation, either tell the unknown
cache to stop listening on the multicast address, or if they are
legitimate, add them to your configuration file.

## DNS lookups for domain names with underscores (_) always fail.

The standards for naming hosts (
_RFC 952_ and
_RFC 1101_) do not allow
underscores in domain names:

>  A "name" (Net, Host, Gateway, or Domain name) is a text string up to 24
    characters drawn from the alphabet (A-Z), digits (0-9), minus sign (-),
    and period (.).

The resolver library that ships with recent versions of BIND enforces
this restriction, returning an error for any host with underscore in the
hostname. The best solution is to complain to the hostmaster of the
offending site, and ask them to rename their host.

See also the
[comp.protocols.tcp-ip.domains FAQ](http://www.intac.com/~cdp/cptd-faq/section4.html#underscore)

Some people have noticed that
_RFC 1033_ implies that
underscores *are* allowed. However, this is an *informational* RFC with
a poorly chosen example, and not a *standard* by any means.

## Why does Squid say: "Illegal character in hostname; underscores are not allowed?'

See the above question. The underscore character is not valid for
hostnames.

Some DNS resolvers allow the underscore, so yes, the hostname might work
fine when you don't use Squid.

To make Squid allow underscores in hostnames, add to squid.conf:
`enable_underscores on`


## Why am I getting access denied from a sibling cache?

The answer to this is somewhat complicated, so please hold on.


An ICP query does not include any parent or sibling designation, so the
receiver really has no indication of how the peer cache is configured to
use it. This issue becomes important when a cache is willing to serve
cache hits to anyone, but only handle cache misses for its paying users
or customers. In other words, whether or not to allow the request
depends on if the result is a hit or a miss. To accomplish this, Squid
acquired the *miss_access* feature in October of 1996.

The necessity of "miss access" makes life a little bit complicated, and
not only because it was awkward to implement. Miss access means that the
ICP query reply must be an extremely accurate prediction of the result
of a subsequent HTTP request. Ascertaining this result is actually very
hard, if not impossible to do, since the ICP request cannot convey the
full HTTP request. Additionally, there are more types of HTTP request
results than there are for ICP. The ICP query reply will either be a hit
or miss. However, the HTTP request might result in a "*304 Not
Modified*" reply sent from the origin server. Such a reply is not
strictly a hit since the peer needed to forward a conditional request to
the source. At the same time, its not strictly a miss either since the
local object data is still valid, and the Not-Modified reply is quite
small.

One serious problem for cache hierarchies is mismatched freshness
parameters. Consider a cache *C* using "strict" freshness parameters so
its users get maximally current data. *C* has a sibling *S* with less
strict freshness parameters. When an object is requested at *C*, *C*
might find that *S* already has the object via an ICP query and ICP HIT
response. *C* then retrieves the object from *S*.

In an HTTP/1.0 world, *C* (and *Cs client) will receive an object that
was never subject to its local freshness rules. Neither HTTP/1.0 nor ICP
provides any way to ask only for objects less than a certain age. If the
retrieved object is stale by*C*s rules, it will be removed from*C*s
cache, but it will subsequently be fetched from*S*so long as it remains
fresh there. This configuration miscoupling problem is a significant
deterrent to establishing both parent and sibling relationships.*

*HTTP/1.1 provides numerous request headers to specify freshness
requirements, which actually introduces a different problem for cache
hierarchies: ICP still does not include any age information, neither in
query nor reply. So*S*may return an ICP HIT if its copy of the object is
fresh by its configuration parameters, but the subsequent HTTP request
may result in a cache miss due to any*Cache-control:*headers originated
by*C*or by*C*'s client. Situations now emerge where the ICP reply no
longer matches the HTTP request result.*

*In the end, the fundamental problem is that the ICP query does not
provide enough information to accurately predict whether the HTTP
request will be a hit or miss. In fact, the current ICP Internet Draft
is very vague on this subject. What does ICP HIT really mean? Does it
mean "I know a little about that URL and have some copy of the object?"
Or does it mean "I have a valid copy of that object and you are allowed
to get it from me?"*

*So, what can be done about this problem? We really need to change ICP
so that freshness parameters are included. Until that happens, the
members of a cache hierarchy have only two options to totally eliminate
the "access denied" messages from sibling caches:*

* Make sure all members have the same *refresh_rules* parameters.
* Do not use *miss_access* at all. Promise your sibling cache
    administrator that*your*cache is properly configured and that you
    will not abuse their generosity. The sibling cache administrator can
    check his log files to make sure you are keeping your word.*

If neither of these is realistic, then the sibling relationship should
not exist.

## Cannot bind socket FD NN to \*:8080 (125) Address already in use

This means that another processes is already listening on port 8080 (or
whatever you're using). It could mean that you have a Squid process
already running, or it could be from another program. To verify, use the
*netstat* command:

    netstat -antup | grep 8080

> :information_source:
    Windows Users need to use *netstat -ant* and manually find the
    entry.

If you find that some process has bound to your port, but you're not
sure which process it is, you might be able to use the excellent
_lsof_ program. It will
show you which processes own every open file descriptor on your system.

## icpDetectClientClose: ERROR xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx: (32) Broken pipe

This means that the client socket was closed by the client before Squid
was finished sending data to it. Squid detects this by trying to
read(2)*some data from the socket. If the*read(2)*call fails, then Squid
knows the socket has been closed. Normally the*read(2)*call
returns*ECONNRESET: Connection reset by peer*and these are NOT logged.
Any other error messages (such as*EPIPE: Broken pipe*are logged
to*cache.log*. See the "intro" of section 2 of your Unix manual for a
list of all error codes.*

## icpDetectClientClose: FD 135, 255 unexpected bytes

These are caused by misbehaving Web clients attempting to use persistent
connections.

## Does Squid work with NTLM Authentication?

Yes, Squid supports Microsoft NTLM authentication to authenticate users
accessing the proxy server itself (be it in a forward or reverse setup).
See [ProxyAuthentication](/Features/Authentication)
for further details

Squid 2.6+ and 3.1+ also support the kind of infrastructure that's
needed to properly allow an user to authenticate against an NTLM-enabled
webserver.

As NTLM authentication backends go, the real work is usually done by
[Samba](http://www.samba.org/) on squid's behalf. That being the case,
Squid supports any authentication backend supported by Samba, including
Samba itself and MS Windows 3.51 and onwards Domain Controllers.

NTLM for HTTP is, however, an horrible example of an authentication
protocol, and we recommend to avoid using it in favour of saner and
standard-sanctioned alternatives such as Digest.

## My Squid becomes very slow after it has been running for some time.

This is most likely because Squid is using more memory than it should be
for your system. When the Squid process becomes large, it experiences a
lot of paging. This will very rapidly degrade the performance of Squid.
Memory usage is a complicated problem. There are a number of things to
consider.

## WARNING: Failed to start 'dnsserver'

> :information_source:
    All current Squid now contain an optimized internal DNS engine.
    Which is much faster and responsive that then the dnsserver helper.
    That should be used by preference.

This could be a permission problem. Does the Squid userid have
permission to execute the dnsserver*program?*

## Sending bug reports to the Squid team

see [SquidFaq/BugReporting](/SquidFaq/BugReporting)

## FATAL: ipcache_init: DNS name lookup tests failed

> :information_source:
    This issue is now permanently resolved in Squid 3.1 and later.

Squid normally tests your system's DNS configuration before it starts
server requests. Squid tries to resolve some common DNS names, as
defined in the dns_testnames*configuration directive. If Squid cannot
resolve these names, it could mean:*

- your DNS nameserver is unreachable or not running.
- your System is in the process of booting
- your /etc/resolv.conf file may contain incorrect information.
- your /etc/resolv.conf file may have incorrect permissions, and may
    be unreadable by Squid.

To disable this feature, use the **-D** command line option. Due to this
issue displaying on Boot. Is is highly recommended that OS startup
scripts for Squid earlier than 3.1 use this option to disable tests.

> :information_source:
    Squid does NOT use the *dnsservers* to test the DNS. The test is
    performed internally, before the dnsservers start.

## FATAL: Failed to make swap directory /var/spool/cache: (13) Permission denied

Starting with version 1.1.15, we have required that you first run

    squid -z

to create the swap directories on your filesystem.

Squid basic default is user **nobody**. This can be overridden in
packages with the **--with-default-user** option when building or in
squid.conf with the **cache_effective_user** option.

The Squid process takes on the given userid before making the
directories. If the

cache_dir

directory (e.g. /var/spool/cache) does not exist, and the Squid userid
does not have permission to create it, then you will get the "permission
denied" error. This can be simply fixed by manually creating the cache
directory.

Alternatively, if the directory already exists, then your operating
system may be returning "Permission Denied" instead of "File Exists" on
the mkdir() system call.

## FATAL: Cannot open HTTP Port

Either

1. the Squid userid does not have permission to bind to the port, or
2. some other process has bound itself to the port
> :information_source:
    Remember that root privileges are required to open port numbers less
    than 1024. If you see this message when using a high port number, or
    even when starting Squid as root, then the port has already been
    opened by another process.

> :information_source:
    SELinux can also deny squid access to port 80, even if you are
    starting squid as root. Configure SELinux to allow squid to open
    port 80 or disable SELinux in this case.

> :information_source:
    Maybe you are running in the HTTP Accelerator mode and there is
    already a HTTP server running on port 80? If you're really stuck,
    install the way cool
    [lsof](ftp://vic.cc.purdue.edu/pub/tools/unix/lsof/) utility to show
    you which process has your port in use.

## FATAL: All redirectors have exited!

This is explained in [Redirectors](/Features/Redirectors).

## FATAL: Cannot open /usr/local/squid/logs/access.log: (13) Permission denied

In Unix, things like processes and files  have an owner.
For Squid, the process owner and file owner should be the same. If
they are not the same, you may get messages like "permission denied."

To find out who owns a file, use the command:

    ls -l

A process is normally owned by the user who starts it. However, Unix
sometimes allows a process to change its owner. If you specified a value
for the *cache_effective_user* option in  squid.conf, then that will
be the process owner. The files must be owned by this
same userid.

If all this is confusing, then you probably should not be running Squid
until you learn some more about Unix. As a reference, I suggest
[Learning the UNIX Operating System, 4thEdition](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/lunix4/).

## pingerOpen: icmp_sock: (13) Permission denied

This means your pinger helper program does not have root privileges.
You should either do this when building Squid:

    make install pinger

or

    # chown root /usr/local/squid/bin/pinger
    # chmod 4755 /usr/local/squid/bin/pinger

> :information_source: location of the pinger binary may vary

## What is a forwarding loop?

A forwarding loop is when a request passes through one proxy more than
once. You can get a forwarding loop if

- a cache forwards requests to itself. This might happen with
    interception caching (or server acceleration) configurations.
- a pair or group of caches forward requests to each other. This can
    happen when Squid uses ICP, Cache Digests, or the ICMP RTT database
    to select a next-hop cache.

Forwarding loops are detected by examining the *Via* request header.
Each cache which "touches" a request must add its hostname to the *Via*
header. If a cache notices its own hostname in this header for an
incoming request, it knows there is a forwarding loop somewhere.

> :warning:
    Squid may report a forwarding loop if a request goes through two
    caches that have the same **visible_hostname** value. If you want
    to have multiple machines with the same **visible_hostname** then
    you must give each machine a different **unique_hostname** so that
    forwarding loops are correctly detected.

When Squid detects a forwarding loop, it is logged to the *cache.log*
file with the received *Via* header. From this header you can determine
which cache (the last in the list) forwarded the request to you.

> :bulb:
    One way to reduce forwarding loops is to change a *parent*
    relationship to a *sibling* relationship.

> :bulb:
    Another way is to use *cache_peer_access* rules.

## accept failure: (71) Protocol error

This error message is seen mostly on Solaris systems.
[Mark Kennedy](mailto:mtk@ny.ubs.com) gives a great explanation:

    Error 71 [EPROTO] is an obscure way of reporting that clients made it onto your
    server's TCP incoming connection queue but the client tore down the
    connection before the server could accept it. I.e. your server ignored
    its clients for too long. We've seen this happen when we ran out of
    file descriptors. I guess it could also happen if something made squid
    block for a long time.


##Why do I get ''fwdDispatch: Cannot retrieve 'https://www.buy.com/corp/ordertracking.asp' ''

These messages are caused by buggy clients, mostly Netscape Navigator.
What happens is, Netscape sends an HTTPS/SSL request over a persistent
HTTP connection. Normally, when Squid gets an SSL request, it looks like
this:

    CONNECT www.buy.com:443 HTTP/1.0

Then Squid opens a TCP connection to the destination host and port, and
the *real* request is sent encrypted over this connection. That's the
whole point of SSL, that all of the information must be sent encrypted.

With this client bug, however, Squid receives a request like this:

    CONNECT https://www.buy.com/corp/ordertracking.asp HTTP/1.0

Now, all of the headers, and the message body have been sent,
*unencrypted* to Squid. There is no way for Squid to somehow turn this
into an SSL request. The only thing we can do is return the error
message.

> :warning:
    This browser bug does represent a **security risk** because the
    browser is sending sensitive information unencrypted over the
    network.

##Squid cannot access URLs like http://3626046468/ab2/cybercards/moreinfo.html

by Dave J Woolley (DJW at bts dot co dot uk)

> :bulb:
    These are illegal URLs, generally only used by illegal sites;
    typically the web site that supports a spammer and is expected to
    survive a few hours longer than the spamming account.

Their intention is to:

- confuse content filtering rules on proxies, and possibly some
    browsers' idea of whether they are trusted sites on the local
    intranet;
- confuse whois(?);
- make people think they are not IP addresses and unknown domain
    names, in an attempt to stop them trying to locate and complain to
    the ISP.

Any browser or proxy that works with them should be considered a
security risk.

[RFC 1738](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt) has this to say about
the hostname part of a URL:

    The fully qualified domain name of a network host, or its IP
    address as a set of four decimal digit groups separated by
    ".". Fully qualified domain names take the form as described
    in Section 3.5 of RFC 1034 [13] and Section 2.1 of RFC 1123
    [5]: a sequence of domain labels separated by ".", each domain
    label starting and ending with an alphanumerical character and
    possibly also containing "-" characters. The rightmost domain
    label will never start with a digit, though, which
    syntactically distinguishes all domain names from the IP
    addresses.

## I get a lot of "URI has whitespace" error messages in my cache log, what should I do?

> :bulb:
    Whitespace characters (space, tab, newline, carriage return) are not
    allowed in URI's and URL's.

Unfortunately, a number of web services generate URL's with whitespace.
Of course your favorite browser silently accommodates these bad URL's.
The servers (or people) that generate these URL's are in violation of
Internet standards. The whitespace characters should be encoded.

If you want Squid to accept URL's with whitespace, you have to decide
how to handle them. There are four choices that you can set with the
*uri_whitespace* option in *squid.conf*:

* STRIP
:   This is the correct way to handle them. This is the default for
    Squid 3.x.
* DENY
:   The request is denied with an "Invalid Request" message. This is
        the default for Squid2.x.
* ALLOW
:   The request is allowed and the URL remains unchanged.
* ENCODE
:   The whitespace characters are encoded according to RFC 1738
* CHOP
:   The URL is chopped at the first whitespace character and then
        processed normally.

Only **STRIP** and **DENY** are the only approved ways of handling these URI.
Others are technically violations and should not be performed. The
broken web service should be fixed instead. It is breaking much more of
the Internet than just your proxy.

## commBind: Cannot bind socket FD 5 to 127.0.0.1:0: (49) Cannot assign requested address

This likely means that your system does not have a loopback network
device, or that device is not properly configured. All Unix systems
should have a network device named `lo0` , and it should be configured with the address 127.0.0.1. If not, you
may get the above error message. To check your system, run:

    ifconfig

> :information_source:
    Windows users must use: **ipfconfig**

The result should contain:

    lo        Link encap:Local Loopback
              inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0
              inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host

## What does "sslReadClient: FD 14: read failure: (104) Connection reset by peer" mean?

"Connection reset by peer" is an error code that Unix operating systems
sometimes return for read, write, connect, and other system calls.

Connection reset means that the other host, the peer, sent us a RESET
packet on a TCP connection. A host sends a RESET when it receives an
unexpected packet for a nonexistent connection. For example, if one side
sends data at the same time that the other side closes a connection,
when the other side receives the data it may send a reset back.

The fact that these messages appear in Squid's log might indicate a
problem, such as a broken origin server or parent cache. On the other
hand, they might be "normal," especially since some applications are
known to force connection resets rather than a proper close.

You probably don't need to worry about them, unless you receive a lot of
user complaints relating to SSL sites.

Rick Jones notes that if the server is running a Microsoft TCP stack,
clients receive RST segments whenever the listen queue overflows. In
other words, if the server is really busy, new connections receive the
reset message. This is contrary to rational behaviour, but is unlikely
to change.

## What does ''Connection refused'' mean?

This is an error message, generated by your operating system, in
response to a connect() system call. It happens when there is no server
at the other end listening on the port number that we tried to connect
to.

It is quite easy to generate this error on your own. Simply telnet to a
random, high numbered port:

    telnet 12345

It happens because there is no server listening for connections on port
12345.

When you see this in response to a URL request, it probably means the
origin server web site is temporarily down. It may also mean that your
parent cache is down, if you have one.

## squid: ERROR: no running copy

You may get this message when you run commands like **squid -k rotate**.

This error message usually means that the *squid.pid* file is missing.
Since the PID file is normally present when squid is
running, the absence of the PID file usually means Squid is not running.
If you accidentally delete the PID file, Squid will continue running,
and you will not be able to send it any signals.

> :information_source:
    If you accidentally removed the PID file, there are two ways to get
    it back.

First locate the process ID by running *ps* and find Squid. You'll
probably see two processes, like this:

    % ps ax | grep squid

      PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
     2267 ?        Ss     0:00 /usr/sbin/squid-ipv6 -D -sYC
     2735 pts/0    S+     0:00 grep squid
     8893 ?        Rl     2:57 (squid) -D -sYC
     8894 ?        Ss     0:17 /bin/bash /etc/squid3/helper/redirector.sh

You want the **(squid)** process id, 8893 in this case.

The first solution is to create the PID file yourself and put the
process id number there. For example:

    echo 8893 > /usr/local/squid/logs/squid.pid

> :warning:
    Be careful of file permissions. It's no use having a .pid file if
    squid cannot update it when things change.

The second is to use the above technique to find the Squid process id.
Then to send the process a HUP signal, which is the same as *squid -k
reconfigure*:

    kill -SIGHUP 8893

The reconfigure process creates a new PID file automatically.

## FATAL: getgrnam failed to find groupid for effective group 'nogroup'

You are probably starting Squid as root. Squid is trying to find a
group-id that doesn't have any special privileges that it will run as.
The default is **nogroup**, but this may not be defined on your system.

The best fix for this is to assign squid a low-privilege user-id and
assign that uerid to a group-id. There is a good chance that *nobody*
will work for you as part of group *nogroup*.

Alternatively in older Squid the *cache_effective_group* in squid.conf
my be changed to the name of an unpriveledged group from */etc/group*.
There is a good chance that *nobody* will work for you.

## Squid uses 100% CPU

There may be many causes for this.

Andrew Doroshenko reports that removing */dev/null*, or mounting a
filesystem with the *nodev* option, can cause Squid to use 100% of CPU.
His suggested solution is to "touch /dev/null."

## urlParse: Illegal character in hostname 'proxy.mydomain.com:8080proxy.mydomain.com'

By Yomler of fnac.net

A combination of a bad configuration of Internet Explorer and any
application which use the cydoor DLLs will produce the entry in the log.
See [cydoor.com](http://www.cydoor.com/) for a complete list.

The bad configuration of IE is the use of a active configuration script
(proxy.pac) and an active or inactive, but filled proxy settings. IE
will only use the proxy.pac. Cydoor aps will use both and will generate
the errors.

Disabling the old proxy settings in IE is not enough, you should delete
them completely and only use the proxy.pac for example.

## Requests for international domain names do not work

by[HenrikNordström](/HenrikNordstrom).

Some people have asked why requests for domain names using national
symbols as "supported" by the certain domain registrars does not work in
Squid. This is because there as of yet is no standard on how to manage
national characters in the current Internet protocols such as HTTP or
DNS. The current Internet standards is very strict on what is an
acceptable hostname and only accepts A-Z a-z 0-9 and - in Internet
hostname labels. Anything outside this is outside the current Internet
standards and will cause interoperability issues such as the problems
seen with such names and Squid.

When there is a consensus in the DNS and HTTP standardization groups on
how to handle international domain names Squid will be changed to
support this if any changes to Squid will be required.

If you are interested in the progress of the standardization process for
international domain names please see the IETF IDN working group's
[dedicated page](http://www.i-d-n.net/).

## Why do I sometimes get "Zero Sized Reply"?

This happens when Squid makes a TCP connection to an origin server, but
for some reason, the connection is closed before Squid reads any data.
Depending on various factors, Squid may be able to retry the request
again. If you see the "Zero Sized Reply" error message, it means that
Squid was unable to retry, or that all retry attempts also failed.

What causes a connection to close prematurely? It could be a number of
things, including:
- An overloaded origin server.
- TCP implementation/interoperability bugs. See the
    [SystemWeirdnesses](/SquidFaq/SystemWeirdnesses)
    for details.
- Race conditions with HTTP persistent connections.
- Buggy or misconfigured NAT boxes, firewalls, and load-balancers.
- Denial of service attacks.
- Utilizing TCP blackholing on FreeBSD (check
    [SystemWeirdnesses](/SquidFaq/SystemWeirdnesses)).

You may be able to use *tcpdump* to track down and observe the problem.

> :information_source:
    Some users believe the problem is caused by very large cookies. One
    user reports that his Zero Sized Reply problem went away when he
    told Internet Explorer to not accept third-party cookies.

Here are some things you can try to reduce the occurrence of the Zero
Sized Reply error:

- Delete or rename your cookie file and configure your browser to
    prompt you before accepting any new cookies.
- Disable HTTP persistent connections with the
    *server_persistent_connections* and
    *client_persistent_connections* directives.
- Disable any advanced TCP features on the Squid system. Disable ECN
    on Linux with *echo 0 \> /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_ecn/*.

If this error causes serious problems for you and the above does not
help, Squid developers would be happy to help you uncover the problem.
However, we will require high-quality debugging information from you,
such as *tcpdump* output, server IP addresses, operating system
versions, and *access.log* entries with full HTTP headers.

If you want to make Squid give the Zero Sized error on demand, you can use
[a short C program](/SquidFaq/TroubleShooting?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=zerosized_reply.c).
Simply compile and start the program on a system that doesn't already
have a server running on port 80. Then try to connect to this fake
server through Squid.

## Why do I get "The request or reply is too large" errors?

by Grzegorz Janoszka

This error message appears when you try downloading large file using GET
or uploading it using POST/PUT. There are several parameters to look
for:

- [request_body_max_size](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/request_body_max_size)
- [reply_body_max_size](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/reply_body_max_size)

These two are set to 0 by default, which means no limits at all. They
should not be limited unless you really know how that affects your squid
behavior. Or at all in standard proxy.

- [request_header_max_size](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/request_header_max_size)
- [reply_header_max_size](http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/reply_header_max_size)

These two default to 64kB starting from [Squid-3.1](/Releases/Squid-3.1).
Earlier versions of Squid had defaults as low as 2 kB. In some rather
rare circumstances even 64kB is too low, so you can increase this value.

## Negative or very large numbers in Store Directory Statistics, or constant complaints about cache above limit

In some situations where swap.state has been corrupted Squid can be very
confused about how much data it has in the cache. Such corruption may
happen after a power failure or similar fatal event. To recover first
stop Squid, then delete the swap.state files from each cache directory
and then start Squid again. Squid will automatically rebuild the
swap.state index from the cached files reasonably well.

If this does not work or causes too high load on your server due to the
reindexing of the cache then delete the cache content as explained in
[OperatingSquid](/SquidFaq/OperatingSquid).
