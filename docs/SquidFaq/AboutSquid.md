# What is Squid?

Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server for web clients,
supporting FTP, gopher, and HTTP data objects. Squid handles all
requests in a single, non-blocking, I/O-driven process over IPv4 or
IPv6.

Squid keeps meta data and especially hot objects and DNS entries cached
in RAM, and implements negative caching of failed requests.

Squid supports SSL, extensive access controls, and full request logging.
By using the lightweight Internet Cache Protocol, Squid caches can be
arranged in a hierarchy or mesh for additional bandwidth savings.

Squid consists of a main server program *squid*, some optional programs
for rewriting requests and performing authentication, and some
management and client tools.

Squid is originally derived from the ARPA-funded [Harvest
project](http://webharvest.sourceforge.net/ng/). Since then it has gone
through many changes and has many new features.

# What is Internet object caching?

Internet object caching is a way to store requested Internet objects
(i.e., data available via the HTTP, FTP, and gopher protocols) on a
system closer to the requesting site than to the source. Web browsers
can then use the local Squid cache as a proxy HTTP server, reducing
access time as well as bandwidth consumption.

# Why is it called Squid?

Harris' Lament says, "All the good ones are taken."

We needed to distinguish this new version from the Harvest cache
software. Squid was the code name for initial development, and it stuck.

# What is the latest version of Squid?

This is best answered by the
[the Downloads page](http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/)
where you can also download the sources.

# Who is responsible for Squid?

Squid is the result of efforts by numerous individuals from the Internet
community:
- The Squid Software Foundation provides representation and oversight
  of the Squid Project
- The core team and main contributors list is at
  [WhoWeAre](/WhoWeAre)
- A list of our many excellent code contributors can be seen in the
  CONTRIBUTORS file within each copy of published sources.

# Where can I get Squid?

You can download Squid via FTP or HTTP from one of the many worldwide
[mirror sites](http://www.squid-cache.org/Download/mirrors.html) or
[the primary FTP site](ftp://ftp.squid-cache.org/pub/)

Many sushi bars and restaurants also serve Squid.

# What Operating Systems does Squid support?

The project routinely tests Squid on Linux, on several popular
distributions including [Debian](http://www.debian.org/) and
derivatives, and
[CentOS](/KnowledgeBase/CentOS)
and other Red Hat inspired projects. We expect Squid to run and build on
just about any modern Linux system.

We also test on [FreeBSD](/KnowledgeBase/FreeBSD)
and [OpenBSD](/KnowledgeBase/OpenBsd),
and Squid is available on these platforms as a package or in the ports
collection.

Squid is also available on MacOS X through [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/)

We expect Squid to run on commercial Unixen such as Solaris or AIX, and
we know it has at some point in time, but we have no way to test it.

Squid is also known to run on [Windows](/KnowledgeBase/Windows)

If you encounter any platform-specific problems, please let us know by
registering an entry in our [bug database](http://bugs.squid-cache.org/).

# How to add a new Squid feature, enhance, of fix something?

Adding new features, enhancing, or fixing Squid behavior usually
requires source code modifications. Several options are generally
available to those who need Squid development:

- **Wait** for somebody to do it: Waiting is free but may take
  forever. If you want to use this option, make sure you file a
  [bug report](http://bugs.squid-cache.org/) describing the bug or
  enhancement so that others know what you need. Posting feature
  requests to a [mailing
  list](http://www.squid-cache.org/Support/mailing-lists.html) is
  often useful because it can generate interest and discussion, but
  without a bug record, your request may be overlooked or forgotten.
- **Do** it yourself: Enhancing Squid and working with other
  developers can be a very rewarding experience. However, this option
  requires understanding and modifying the source code, which is
  getting better, but it is still very complex, often ugly, and
  lacking documentation. These obstacles affect the required
  development effort. In most cases, you would want your changes to be
  incorporated into the official Squid sources for long-term support.
  To get the code committed, one needs to cooperate with other
  developers. It is a good idea to describe the changes you are going
  to work on before diving into development. Development-related
  discussions happen on
  [squid-dev mailing list](http://www.squid-cache.org/Support/mailing-lists.html#squid-dev).
  Documenting upcoming changes as a [bug report](http://bugs.squid-cache.org/)
- **Pay** somebody to do it: Many organizations and individuals offer
  commercial Squid development
  [services](http://www.squid-cache.org/Support/services.html). When
  selecting the developer, discuss how they plan to integrate the
  changes with the official Squid sources and consider the company
  past contributions to the Squid project. Please see the "Can I pay
  someone for Squid support?" entry for more details.

The best development option depends on many factors. Here is some
project dynamics information that may help you pick the right one: Most
Squid features and maintenance is done by individual contributors,
working alone or in small development/consulting shops. In the early
years (1990-2000), these developers were able to work on Squid using
their free time, research grants, or similarly broad-scope financial
support. Requested features were often added on-demand because many
folks could work on them. Most recent (2006-2008) contributions,
especially large features, are the result of paid development contracts,
reflecting both the maturity of software and the lack of "free" time
among active Squid developers.

# Can I pay someone for Squid support?

Yes. Please see
[Squid Support Services](http://www.squid-cache.org/Support/services.html).
Unfortunately, that page is poorly maintained and has many stale/bogus
entries, so exercise caution. Please do *not* email the Squid Project
asking for official recommendations -- the Project itself cannot
recommend specific Squid administrators or developers due to various
conflicts of interests. However, if the Project could make official
referrals, they would probably form a (tiny) subset of the
[listed entries](http://www.squid-cache.org/Support/services.html).

Besides the Services page, you can post a Request For Proposals to
[Squid Users](http://www.squid-cache.org/Support/mailing-lists.html#squid-users)
(Squid administration and integration) or
[Squid Developers](http://www.squid-cache.org/Support/mailing-lists.html#squid-dev)
mailing list. A good RFP contains enough details
(including your deadlines and Squid versions) for the respondents to
provide a ballpark cost estimate. Expect private responses to your RFPs
and avoid discussing private arrangements on the public mailing lists.
Please do *not* email RFPs to the Project info@ alias for the reasons
discussed in the previous paragraph.

You can also [donate](http://www.squid-cache.org/Foundation/donate.html)
money or equipment to the Squid project.
