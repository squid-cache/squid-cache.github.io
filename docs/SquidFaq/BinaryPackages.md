# Binary Packages for Squid

## Do you have pre-compiled binaries available?

The squid core team members do not have the resources to make
pre-compiled binaries available. Instead, we invest effort into making
the source code very portable and rely on others to provide such
packaging as needed.

## How do I install a binary for ...?

Most operating system distributions provide packages in the formats
appropriate for direct install on those systems. Please thank them.

We are aware of Squid binary packages being available as part of the 
operating system for:
* [CentOS](/KnowledgeBase/CentOS)
* [Debian](/KnowledgeBase/Debian)
* [Fedora](/KnowledgeBase/Fedora)
* [Fink](/KnowledgeBase/Fink)
* [FreeBSD](/KnowledgeBase/FreeBSD)
* [Gentoo](/KnowledgeBase/Gentoo)
* [Mandriva](/KnowledgeBase/Mandriva)
* [NetBSD](/KnowledgeBase/NetBSD)
* [OpenSUSE](/KnowledgeBase/OpenSUSE)
* [RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)](/KnowledgeBase/RedHat)
* [Slackware](/KnowledgeBase/Slackware)
* [Ubuntu](/KnowledgeBase/Ubuntu)

And from third parties, for:
* [Mac OS](/KnowledgeBase/MacOs)
* [Windows](/KnowledgeBase/Windows)

## Can I get support for Squid version.. ?

If you are using a version of squid through some paid operating system
(e.g. Red Hat Enterprise), then your supplier is your best first line
of support.

Oftentimes distributions package oldish or old versions of Squid, and
in most cases they include backports and OS-specific integrations. The
Squid developers have generally no idea about how these are implemented, and
most likely have no way to reproduce any issue you might find.
There is a strong chance that if you came to us asking for support, the
answer would be "please upgrade to the latest version as distributed by us".
So please rely on your operating system's community and bug reporting
systems as your first line of support

But then, Squid users and develoers are a nice community with a genuine
desire to help and they will, if they can.
The
[squid users community](http://www.squid-cache.org/Support/mailing-lists.html#squid-users)
will be the best source of help for questions about configuring and operating
squid.
