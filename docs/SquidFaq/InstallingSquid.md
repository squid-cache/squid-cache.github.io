# Installing Squid

From [Binary Packages](/SquidFaq/BinaryPackages)
if available for your operating system, or from from source.

After
[SquidFaq/CompilingSquid](/SquidFaq/CompilingSquid),
you can install it with this simple command:

    % make install

If you have enabled ICMP or the
[pinger](/SquidFaq/OperatingSquid)
then you will also want to type

    % su
    # make install-pinger

After installing, you will want to read
[SquidFaq/ConfiguringSquid](/SquidFaq/ConfiguringSquid)
to edit and customize Squid to run the way you want it to.

## How do I start Squid?

First you need to check your Squid configuration. The Squid
configuration can be found in */usr/local/squid/etc/squid.conf* and
includes documentation on all directives.

In the Squid distribution there is a small QUICKSTART guide indicating
which directives you need to look closer at and why. At a absolute
minimum you need to change the http_access configuration to allow
access from your clients.

To verify your configuration file you can use the -k parse option

    % /usr/local/squid/sbin/squid -k parse

If this outputs any errors then these are syntax errors or other fatal
misconfigurations and needs to be corrected before you continue. If it
is silent and immediately gives back the command prompt then your
squid.conf is syntactically correct and could be understood by Squid.

After you've finished editing the configuration file, you can start
Squid for the first time. The procedure depends a little bit on which
version you are using.

First, you must create the swap directories. Do this by running Squid
with the -z option:

    % /usr/local/squid/sbin/squid -z


> :warning:
    If you run Squid as root then you may need to first
    create */usr/local/squid/var/logs* and your *cache_dir* directories and
    assign ownership of these to the cache_effective_user configured
    in your squid.conf

Once the creation of the cache directories completes, you can start
Squid and try it out. Probably the best thing to do is run it from your
terminal and watch the debugging output. Use this command:

    % /usr/local/squid/sbin/squid -NCd1

If everything is working okay, you will see the line:

    Ready to serve requests.

If you want to run squid in the background, as a daemon process, just
leave off all options:

    % /usr/local/squid/sbin/squid

> :warning:
    Depending on which http_port you select you may need to start
    squid as root (if http_port <1024)

## How do I start Squid automatically when the system boots?

### by hand

Squid has a restart feature built in. This greatly simplifies starting
Squid and means that you don't need to use *RunCache* or *inittab*. At
the minimum, you only need to enter the pathname to the Squid
executable. For example:

    /usr/local/squid/sbin/squid

Squid will automatically background itself and then spawn a child
process. In your *syslog* messages file, you should see something like
this:

    Sep 23 23:55:58 kitty squid[14616]: Squid Parent: child process 14617 started

That means that process ID 14563 is the parent process which monitors
the child process (pid 14617). The child process is the one that does
all of the work. The parent process just waits for the child process to
exit. If the child process exits unexpectedly, the parent will
automatically start another child process. In that case, *syslog* shows:

    Sep 23 23:56:02 kitty squid[14616]: Squid Parent: child process 14617 exited with status 1
    Sep 23 23:56:05 kitty squid[14616]: Squid Parent: child process 14619 started

If there is some problem, and Squid can not start, the parent process
will give up after a while. Your *syslog* will show:

    Sep 23 23:56:12 kitty squid[14616]: Exiting due to repeated, frequent failures

When this happens you should check your *syslog* messages and
*cache.log* file for error messages.

When you look at a process (*ps* command) listing, you'll see two squid
processes:

    24353  ??  Ss     0:00.00 /usr/local/squid/bin/squid
    24354  ??  R      0:03.39 (squid) (squid)

The first is the parent process, and the child process is the one called
"(squid)". Note that if you accidentally kill the parent process, the
child process will not notice.

If you want to run Squid from your termainal and prevent it from
backgrounding and spawning a child process, use the *-N* command line
option.

    /usr/local/squid/bin/squid -N

### from inittab

On systems which have an */etc/inittab* file (Digital Unix, old Solaris,
IRIX, HP-UX, Linux), you can add a line like this:

    sq:3:respawn:/usr/local/squid/sbin/squid.sh < /dev/null >> /tmp/squid.log 2>&1

We recommend using a *squid.sh* shell script, but you could instead call
Squid directly with the -N option and other options you may require. A
sample *squid.sh* script is shown below:

    C=/usr/local/squid
    PATH=/usr/bin:$C/bin
    TZ=PST8PDT
    export PATH TZ

    # User to notify on restarts
    notify="root"

    # Squid command line options
    opts=""

    cd $C
    umask 022
    sleep 10
    while [ -f /var/run/nosquid ]; do
            sleep 1
    done
    /usr/bin/tail -20 $C/logs/cache.log \
            | Mail -s "Squid restart on `hostname` at `date`" $notify
    exec bin/squid -N $opts

### from rc.local

On BSD-ish systems, you will need to start Squid from the "rc" files,
usually */etc/rc.local*. For example:

    if [ -f /usr/local/squid/sbin/squid ]; then
            echo -n ' Squid'
            /usr/local/squid/sbin/squid
    fi

### from init.d

Squid ships with a init.d type startup script in contrib/squid.rc which
works on most init.d type systems. Or you can write your own using any
normal init.d script found in your system as template and add the
start/stop fragments shown below.

Start:

    /usr/local/squid/sbin/squid

Stop:

    /usr/local/squid/sbin/squid -k shutdown
    n=120
    while /usr/local/squid/sbin/squid -k check && [ $n -gt 0 ]; do
        sleep 1
        echo -n .
        n=`expr $n - 1`
    done

### with daemontools

Create squid service directory, and the log directory (if it does not
exist yet).

    mkdir -p /usr/local/squid/supervise/log /var/log/squid
    chown squid /var/log/squid

Then, change to the service directory,

    cd /usr/local/squid/supervise

and create 2 executable scripts: **run**

    rm -f /var/run/squid/squid.pid
    exec /usr/local/squid/sbin/squid -N 2>&1

and **log/run**.

    exec /usr/local/bin/multilog t /var/log/squid

Finally, start the squid service by linking it into svscan monitored
area.

    cd /service
    ln -s /usr/local/squid/supervise squid

Squid should start within 5 seconds.

### from SMF

On new Solaris (10 and above) inittab/sysvinit is deprecated and is
recommended to use new SMF (Service Management Facility).

To do that you need to create service manifest in XML format like this:

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <!DOCTYPE service_bundle SYSTEM "/usr/share/lib/xml/dtd/service_bundle.dtd.1">
    <!--   Manifest-file for Squid

    </service>

    </service_bundle>

then put this file in /var/svc/manifest/network directory and execute
command

    svccfg import /var/svc/manifest/network/squid.xml

as root. Then create init-like script (named service method) with
command-line arguments start|stop|refresh|restart, put it into
/lib/svc/method, and execute command

    svcadm enable squid

Solaris here:
[squid_autostart25.tar.gz](/SquidFaq/InstallingSquid?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=squid_autostart25.tar.gz)

## How do I tell if Squid is running?

You can use the *squidclient* program:

    % squidclient http://www.netscape.com/ > test

There are other command-line HTTP client programs available as well. Two
that you may find useful are
_wget_ and
_echoping_.

Another way is to use Squid itself to see if it can signal a running
Squid process:

    % squid -k check

And then check the shell's exit status variable.

Also, check the log files, most importantly the *access.log* and
*cache.log* files.

## squid command line options

These are the command line options:

**-a** Specify an alternate port number for incoming HTTP requests.
Useful for testing a configuration file on a non-standard port.

**-d** Debugging level for "stderr" messages. If you use this option,
then debugging messages up to the specified level will also be written
to stderr.

**-f** Specify an alternate *squid.conf* file instead of the pathname
compiled into the executable.

**-h** Prints the usage and help message.

**-k reconfigure** Sends a *HUP* signal, which causes Squid to re-read
its configuration files.

**-k rotate** Sends an *USR1* signal, which causes Squid to rotate its
log files. Note, if *logfile_rotate* is set to zero, Squid still closes
and re-opens all log files.

**-k shutdown** Sends a *TERM* signal, which causes Squid to wait
briefly for current connections to finish and then exit. The amount of
time to wait is specified with *shutdown_lifetime*.

**-k interrupt** Sends an *INT* signal, which causes Squid to shutdown
immediately, without waiting for current connections.

**-k kill** Sends a *KILL* signal, which causes the Squid process to
exit immediately, without closing any connections or log files. Use this
only as a last resort.

**-k debug** Sends an *USR2* signal, which causes Squid to generate full
debugging messages until the next *USR2* signal is received. Obviously
very useful for debugging problems.

**-k check** Sends a "*ZERO*" signal to the Squid process. This simply
checks whether or not the process is actually running.

**-s** Send debugging (level 0 only) message to syslog.

**-u** Specify an alternate port number for ICP messages. Useful for
testing a configuration file on a non-standard port.

**-v** Prints the Squid version.

**-z** Creates disk swap directories. You must use this option when
installing Squid for the first time, or when you add or modify the
*cache_dir* configuration.

**-D** Do not make initial DNS tests. Normally, Squid looks up some
well-known DNS hostnames to ensure that your DNS name resolution service
is working properly.
:bulb:
obsolete in 3.1 and later.

**-F** If the *swap.state* logs are clean, then the cache is rebuilt in
the "foreground" before any requests are served. This will decrease the
time required to rebuild the cache, but HTTP requests will not be
satisfied during this time.

**-N** Do not automatically become a background daemon process.

**-R** Do not set the SO_REUSEADDR option on sockets.

**-X** Enable full debugging while parsing the config file.

**-Y** Return ICP_OP_MISS_NOFETCH instead of ICP_OP_MISS while the
*swap.state* file is being read. If your cache has mostly child caches
which use ICP, this will allow your cache to rebuild faster.

## How do I see how Squid works?

- Check the *cache.log* file in your logs directory. It logs
interesting things as a part of its normal operation and can be
boosted to show all the boring details.
- Install and use the [CacheManager](/Features/CacheManager).

## Can Squid benefit from SMP systems?

Squid is a single process application and can not make use of SMP. If
you want to make Squid benefit from a SMP system you will need to run
multiple instances of Squid and find a way to distribute your users on
the different Squid instances just as if you had multiple Squid boxes.

Having two CPUs is indeed nice for running other CPU intensive tasks on
the same server as the proxy, such as if you have a lot of logs and need
to run various statistics collections during peak hours.

The authentication and group helpers barely use any CPU and does not
benefit much from dual-CPU configuration.

## Is it okay to use separate drives for Squid?

Yes. Running Squid on separate drives to that which your OS is running
is often a very good idea.

Generally seek time is what you want to optimize for Squid, or more
precisely the total amount of seeks/s your system can sustain. This is
why it is better to have your cache_dir spread over multiple smaller
disks than one huge drive (especially with SCSI).

If your system is very I/O bound, you will want to have both your OS and
log directories running on separate drives.

## Is it okay to use RAID on Squid?

see Section on [RAID](/SquidFaq/RAID)

## Is it okay to use ZFS on Squid?

Yes. Running Squid on native ZFS-supporting systems, like Solaris or
[OpenIndiana](http://openindiana.org) is well-known practice.

In general, just set up ZFS mirror (usually the best with separate
controllers for each spindle) and set recordsize 4-64k (depending your
cache preferable cache_replacement_policy). Also it can better for
disk IO performance to change primarycache=metadata and
secondarycache=none, and atime=off on cache_dir filesystems. Consider
to correctly set **logbias** property for zfs fs which Squid's cache
stores. Default value for this property is *latency*, which is
appropriate for software ZFS raid/mirror. When ZFS created over hardware
RAID5/10, set this property to *throughput* to avoid much
TCP_SWAPFAIL_MISS. On system level the good idea is limiting ZFS ARC
size to 1/8-1/4 of RAM by setting zfs:zfs_arc_max.

ZFS works perfectly both diskd and aufs Squid storeIO modules (best
choise depending your box/storage architecture).
