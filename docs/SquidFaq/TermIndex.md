# Squid terminology

## Neighbor

In Squid, *neighbor* usually means the same thing as *peer*. A neighbor
cache is one that you have defined with the *cache_peer* configuration
option. Neighbor refers to either a parent or a sibling.

In Harvest 1.4, neighbor referred to what Squid calls a sibling. That
is, Harvest had *parents* and *neighbors*. For backward compatibility,
the term neighbor is still accepted in some Squid configuration options.

## Regular Expression

Regular expressions are patterns that used for matching sequences of
characters in text. For more information, see
